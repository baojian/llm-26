= Du Fu =
Du Fu ( Wade – Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : 杜 ##甫 ; 71 ##2 – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li B ##ai ( Li Po ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An L ##ush ##an Rebellion of 75 ##5 , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest .
Although initially he was little @ - @ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the " Poet @ - @ Historian " and the " Poet @ - @ Sage " by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as " the Chinese Virgil , Horace , Ov ##id , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , Wordsworth , B ##ér ##anger , Hugo or Baud ##ela ##ire " .
= = Life = =
Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to " the close links that traditional Chinese thought pos ##its between art and morality " . Since many of Du Fu ' s poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William Hung , is that Chinese poems are typically conc ##ise , om ##itting context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , " The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunder ##stand the poem or fail to understand it altogether " . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet ' s work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the " redu ##ctive " categor ##izations used for more limited poets .
= = = Early years = = =
Most of what is known of Du Fu ' s life comes from his poems . His paternal grandfather was Du Shen ##yan , a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu . Du Fu was born in 71 ##2 ; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near Lu ##oy ##ang , Hen ##an province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ) . In later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang ' an , ancestral hometown of the Du family .
Du Fu ' s mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his aunt . He had an elder brother , who died young . He also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers in his poems , although he never mentions his stepmother .
The son of a minor scholar @ - @ official , his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant : study and memor ##isation of the Confucian classics of philosophy , history and poetry . He later claimed to have produced credit ##able poems by his early teens , but these have been lost .
In the early 73 ##0s , he travelled in the Jiang ##s ##u / Z ##he ##jiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 73 ##5 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang ' an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics . Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Ch ##ou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame . After this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around Shand ##ong and He ##be ##i .
His father died around 740 . Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father ' s rank , but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers . He spent the next four years living in the Lu ##oy ##ang area , fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs .
In the autumn of 74 ##4 , he met Li B ##ai ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as " the most significant formative element in Du Fu ' s artistic development " because it gave him a living example of the rec ##lus ##ive poet @ - @ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @ - @ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li B ##ai was already a poetic star . We have twelve poems to or about Li B ##ai from the younger poet , but only one in the other direction . They met again only once , in 74 ##5 .
In 74 ##6 , he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career . He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals ) . He never again attempted the examinations , instead petition ##ing the emperor directly in 75 ##1 , 75 ##4 and probably again in 75 ##5 . He married around 75 ##2 , and by 757 the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in 75 ##5 . From 75 ##4 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first of a series of ail ##ments which dog ##ged him for the rest of his life . It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region .
In 75 ##5 , he received an appointment as Regist ##rar of the Right Commandant ' s office of the Crown Prince ' s Palace . Although this was a minor post , in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career . Even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept away by events .
= = = War = = =
The An L ##ush ##an Rebellion began in December 75 ##5 , and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years . It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society : the census of 75 ##4 recorded 52 @ . @ 9 million people , but ten years later , the census counted just 16 @ . @ 9 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed . During this time , Du Fu led a largely itiner ##ant life unsettled by wars , associated fam ##ines and imperial displeasure . This period of unh ##app ##iness was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Ch ##ou has written that , " What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry " . Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child , he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own mis ##f ##ortun ##es . Du Fu wrote :
Bro ##oding on what I have lived through , if even I know such suffering , the common man must surely be ratt ##led by the winds .
In 75 ##6 , Emperor X ##uan ##zong was forced to flee the capital and abd ##icate . Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor ( Suz ##ong ) , but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang ' an . In the autumn , his youngest son , Du Z ##ong ##wu ( Baby Bear ) , was born . Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria .
He escaped from Chang ' an the following year , and was appointed Rem ##inder when he rejoined the court in May 757 . This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial . Du Fu ' s consc ##ient ##ious ##ness compelled him to try to make use of it : he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Gu ##an on a petty charge . He was arrested but was pardoned in June . He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8 , 757 , he returned to Chang ' an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces . However , his advice continued to be un ##app ##rec ##iated , and in the summer of 75 ##8 he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in Hu ##az ##hou . The position was not to his taste : in one poem , he wrote :
I am about to scream mad ##ly in the office / E ##specially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk .
He moved on in the summer of 75 ##9 ; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine , but Hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason . He next spent around six weeks in Q ##inz ##hou ( now T ##ians ##hu ##i , G ##ans ##u province ) , where he wrote more than sixty poems .
= = = Cheng ##du = = =
In December 75 ##9 , he briefly stayed in Tong ##gu ( modern G ##ans ##u ) . He departed on December 24 for Cheng ##du ( S ##ichuan province ) , where he was hosted by local Pre ##fect and fellow poet Pei Di . Du subsequently based himself in S ##ichuan for most of the next five years . By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble , and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances . He was relieved by Yan Wu , a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Cheng ##du . Despite his financial problems , this was one of the happ ##iest and most peaceful periods of his life . Many of Du ' s poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at " that ##ched hut " . In 76 ##2 , he left the city to escape a rebellion , but he returned in summer 76 ##4 when he was appointed an advisor to Yan , who was involved in campaigns against the Tibetan Empire .
= = = Last years = = =
Lu ##oy ##ang , the region of his birthplace , was recovered by government forces in the winter of 76 ##2 , and in the spring of 76 ##5 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze , apparently with the intention of making their way there . They traveled slowly , held up by his ill @ - @ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight , deaf ##ness and general old age in addition to his previous ail ##ments ) . They stayed in Ku ##iz ##hou ( in what is now B ##aid ##iche ##ng , Chong ##qing ) at the entrance to the Three Gor ##ges for almost two years from late spring 76 ##6 . This period was Du Fu ' s last great poetic flowering , and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense , late style . In autumn 76 ##6 , Bo Ma ##olin became governor of the region : he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary .
In March 76 ##8 , he began his journey again and got as far as Hun ##an province , where he died in Tanz ##hou ( now Chang ##sha ) in November or December 770 , in his 58th year . He was survived by his wife and two sons , who remained in the area for some years at least . His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuan Z ##hen in 81 ##3 .
Hung summar ##ises his life by concluding that , " He appeared to be a fil ##ial son , an affection ##ate father , a generous brother , a faithful husband , a loyal friend , a dut ##iful official , and a patriotic subject . "
Below is an example of one of Du Fu ' s later works , To My Ret ##ired Friend Wei ( Chinese : 贈 ##衛 ##八 ##處 ##士 ) . Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long part ##ing between friends , which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces :
= = Works = =
Criticism of Du Fu ' s works has focused on his strong sense of history , his moral engagement , and his technical excellence .
= = = History = = =
Since the Song dynasty , critics have called Du Fu the " poet historian " ( 詩 ##史 sh ##ī sh ##ǐ ) . The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor . Ind ##irect ##ly , he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of China . As Watson notes , this is information " of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era " .
Du Fu ' s political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation : his presc ##riptions have been par ##aph ##r ##ased as , " Let us all be less selfish , let us all do what we are supposed to do " . Since his views were impossible to disagree with , his force ##fully expressed tru ##isms enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history .
= = = Mor ##al engagement = = =
A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of " poet sage " ( 詩 ##聖 sh ##ī sh ##è ##ng ) , a counterpart to the philosophical sage , Confuc ##ius . One of the earliest surviving works , The Song of the Wag ##ons ( from around 750 ) , gives voice to the suffer ##ings of a consc ##ript soldier in the imperial army and a clear @ - @ sighted consciousness of suffering . These concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life .
Although Du Fu ' s frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all @ - @ consuming sol ##ips ##ism , Hawkes argues that his " famous compassion in fact includes himself , viewed quite object ##ively and almost as an after ##though ##t " . He therefore " lends grandeur " to the wider picture by comparing it to " his own slightly comical trivial ##ity " .
Du Fu ' s compassion , for himself and for others , was part of his general broad ##ening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment . Zhang J ##ie wrote that for Du Fu , " everything in this world is poetry " , Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life , call ##igrap ##hy , paintings , animals , and other poems .
= = = Technical excellence = = =
Du Fu ' s work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics traditionally used the term 集 ##大 ##成 ( j ##í ##d ##à ##ch ##é ##ng - " complete symphony " ) , a reference to M ##enc ##ius ' description of Confuc ##ius . Yuan Z ##hen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu ' s achievement , writing in 81 ##3 that his predecessor , " united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly " . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Ch ##ou says that in every form he " either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples " . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registers , from the direct and colloqu ##ial to the all ##usive and self @ - @ consciously literary . This variety is manifested even within individual works : Owen identifies the , " rapid stylistic and thematic shifts " in poems which enable the poet to represent different fac ##ets of a situation , while Ch ##ou uses the term " juxtap ##osition " as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for having written more on poet ##ics and painting than any other writer of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than any other Tang poet . Du Fu ' s seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Han Gan ignited a controversy that has persisted to the present day .
The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ( " ch ##am ##ele ##on @ - @ like " according to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a relatively derivative , court ##ly style , but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion . Owen comments on the " grim simplicity " of the Q ##inz ##hou poems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from his Cheng ##du period are " light , often finely observed " ; while the poems from the late Ku ##iz ##hou period have a " density and power of vision " .
Although he wrote in all poetic forms , Du Fu is best known for his l ##ǜ ##shi , a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content , for example :
About two thirds of Du Fu ' s 1500 extant works are in this form , and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent . His best l ##ǜ ##shi use the parallel ##isms required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions . Hawkes comments that , " it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner " .
= = Influence = =
According to the Ency ##clop ##æd ##ia Britann ##ica , Du Fu ' s writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it states " his dense , compressed language makes use of all the conn ##ot ##ative overtones of a phrase and of all the int ##on ##ational potential ##s of the individual word , qualities that no translation can ever reveal . "
In his lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated . In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations , some of which are still " considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics . " There are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection , but not as a par ##agon of poetic or moral ideals . Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry .
However , as Hung notes , he " is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time " , and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came from B ##ai Ju ##yi , who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu ' s works ( although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li B ##ai on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them . Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work . By the beginning of the 10th century , Wei Zhu ##ang constructed the first replica of his that ##ched cottage in S ##ichuan .
It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu ' s reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive re @ - @ evaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang Wei , Li B ##ai and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , Dao ##ist and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo @ - @ Confucian ##ism ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic exempl ##ar , occupied the par ##amount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was " preem ##inent . . . because . . . through all his vic ##iss ##itudes , he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign " . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opp ##os ##ites : political conservatives were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . Since the establishment of the People ' s Republic of China , Du Fu ' s loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embry ##onic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simple , " people ' s language " .
Du Fu ' s popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : B ##ai Ju ##yi ' s concern for the poor , Lu You ' s patriotism , and Me ##i Ya ##oc ##hen ' s reflections on the quot ##idian are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu ' s work in transforming the l ##ǜ ##shi from mere word play into " a vehicle for serious poetic utter ##ance " set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre .
In the 20th century , he was the favourite poet of Kenneth Rex ##ro ##th , who has described him as " the greatest non @ - @ epic , non @ - @ dramatic poet who has survived in any language " , and commented that , " he has made me a better man , as a moral agent and as a perce ##iving organism " .
= = = Influence on Japanese literature = = =
Du Fu ' s poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature , especially on the literature from the Mur ##om ##achi period and on scholars and poets in the Edo period , including Matsu ##o Bash ##ō , the very greatest of all ha ##iku poets . Even in modern Japanese , the term Saint of Poetry ( 詩 ##聖 , sh ##ise ##i ) is mostly synonymous with Du Fu .
Until the 13th century , the Japanese preferred B ##ai Ju ##yi above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu , although his influence can be seen in some k ##ans ##hi ( " Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets " ) anthologies such as B ##unk ##a Sh ##ū ##re ##ish ##ū in the 9th century . The first notable Japanese apprec ##iator of Du Fu ' s poetry was Kok ##an Shir ##en ( 127 ##8 – 134 ##6 ) , a R ##inz ##ai Zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol . 11 of S ##ai ##h ##ok ##ush ##ū . His student Ch ##ū ##gan Eng ##etsu composed many k ##ans ##hi which were clearly stated " influenced by Du Fu " in their pref ##aces . Ch ##ū ##gan ' s student G ##id ##ō Sh ##ū ##sh ##in had close connection with the Court and Ash ##ik ##aga Sh ##og ##unate and propagated Du Fu ' s poetry in the mundane world ; one day N ##ij ##ō Yosh ##imoto , the Kamp ##aku regent of the Court and the highest authority of r ##enga poetry , asked G ##id ##ō , " Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li B ##ai ? " G ##id ##ō d ##ared to reply , " Yes if you do have enough capability . No if do not . " Since then , there had been many semin ##ars on Du Fu ' s poetry both in Zen temples and in the aristocratic society , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Mur ##om ##achi period , e . g . , Tai ##he ##iki , a historical epic in the late 14th century , and some no ##h plays such as Hy ##ak ##uman , Bash ##ō , and Sh ##unk ##an .
During the Kan ' e ##i era of the Edo period ( 162 ##4 – 1643 ) , Sh ##à ##o Chu ##án ( 邵 ##傳 ) of the Ming Dynasty ' s Coll ##ective Comment ##ary on Du Fu ' s L ##ǜ ##shi ( 杜 ##律 ##集 ##解 , Tor ##itsu Sh ##ikk ##ai ) was imported into Japan , and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and ch ##ō ##n ##in ( townspeople ) class . The commentary established Du Fu ' s fame as the highest of all poets ; for instance , Hay ##ashi Sh ##uns ##ai , a notable Confucian scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of G ##ah ##ō Bun ##sh ##ū that Z ##ǐ ##m ##ě ##i [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised Sh ##à ##o Chu ##án ' s commentary for its simplicity and read ##ability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too unf ##ath ##om ##able . Matsu ##o Bash ##ō , the greatest ha ##iku poet , was also strongly influenced by Du Fu ; in Ok ##u no Hos ##om ##ichi , his masterpiece , he cites the first two lines of A Spring View ( 春 ##望 ) before a ha ##iku as its introduction and also many of his other ha ##iku have similar wording and themes . It is said that when he died in Osaka during a long travel , a copy of Du Fu ' s poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around .
= = Transl ##ation = =
A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu ' s work into English . As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu , " There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible " ( p . xx ##ii ) . The transl ##ators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding lab ##oured to a Western ear ( particularly when translating regulated verse , or l ##ǜ ##shi ) , and accommod ##ating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works ( Hawkes writes that " his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation " — p . i ##x ) . One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rex ##ro ##th ' s One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free translations , which seek to conceal the parallel ##isms through en ##j ##amb ##ement and expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly to o ##mit most of these poems from his selection , and second ##ly to " translate out " the references in those works which he does select .
Other transl ##ators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu . Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Po ##ets uses English @ - @ style rhyme schemes , whereas Keith Holy ##o ##ak in Facing the Moon approx ##imates the Chinese rhyme scheme ; both use end @ - @ stopped lines and preserve some degree of parallel ##ism . In The Selected Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows the parallel ##isms quite strictly , persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa . Similarly , he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive ann ##ot ##ation .
In 2015 , Stephen Owen published translations , with facing Chinese texts , of the complete poetry of Du Fu in six volumes , with extensive scholarly apparatus , which emphasized literal ##ness .

= I ##se @ - @ class battleship =
The I ##se @ - @ class battleships ( 伊 ##勢 ##型 ##戦 ##艦 , I ##se @ - @ g ##ata sen ##kan ) were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during World War I . Originally intended to be repeats of the preceding Fus ##ō class , they were redesigned before construction began . Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kant ##ō earthquake in 1923 . They were modernized in 1934 – 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pag ##oda mast style . Afterwards they played a minor role in the Second Sino @ - @ Japanese War .
Despite the expensive reconstruct ##ions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the IJN ' s large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @ - @ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of float ##planes . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape Eng ##a ##ño in late 1944 , where they dec ##oy ##ed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation K ##ita , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstri ##kes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 .
= = Background = =
The design of the Fus ##ō @ - @ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters . The IJN ' s fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905 , the last year of the Russo @ - @ Japanese War , which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of Ts ##ushima .
In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . Sat ##ō T ##ets ##ut ##ar ##ō , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , Sat ##ō theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @ , @ 000 long tons ( 20 @ , @ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @ , @ 000 long tons ( 18 @ , @ 289 t ) each . This was the genes ##is of the Eight @ - @ Eight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships .
The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complicated Japan ' s plans . Dis ##pl ##acing 17 @ , @ 900 long tons ( 18 @ , @ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @ - @ inch ( 30 @ . @ 5 cm ) guns , Dreadnought rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison . The launch of the battlecruiser HMS Invincible the following year was a further setback for Japan ' s quest for parity . When the two new S ##ats ##uma @ - @ class battleships and two Ts ##uk ##uba @ - @ class armoured cruisers , launched by 1911 , were out ##cl ##assed by their British counterparts , the Eight @ - @ Eight Fleet Program was restarted .
The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @ - @ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the Kaw ##achi class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the Fus ##ō class were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more Fus ##ō @ - @ class ships ( Yamash ##iro , I ##se , and Hy ##ū ##ga ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 . While Yamash ##iro was laid down later that year , the IJN lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of I ##se and Hy ##ū ##ga until the Diet authorized additional funding for the ships in July 1914 .
= = Design and description = =
The progress of Fus ##ō ' s construction , while the IJN waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the IJN to reass ##ess the Fus ##ō @ - @ class design . The distribution of the mid ##ships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the mid ##ships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired . Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @ . @ 36 @ - @ kilogram ( 100 @ . @ 0 lb ) shells used in the manually loaded 152 @ - @ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the Fus ##ō class and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , the IJN designed a smaller 140 @ - @ millimetre ( 5 @ . @ 5 in ) gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @ - @ class battleships and Russian Borod ##ino @ - @ class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @ . @ 5 knots ( 0 @ . @ 93 km / h ; 0 @ . @ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower mid ##ships gun turret was lower than in the Fus ##ō class . This reduced the crew ' s accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew ' s numbers and naval historian Fuk ##ui Sh ##iz ##uo believed that these ships had the worst habit ##ability of any Japanese capital ship . The final design was designated A @ - @ 92 by the IJN and differed enough from the A @ - @ 64 design of the Fus ##ō class that it was considered a separate class .
The ships had a length of 208 @ . @ 18 metres ( 68 ##3 ft 0 in ) overall , a beam of 28 @ . @ 65 metres ( 94 ft 0 in ) and a draught of 8 @ . @ 93 metres ( 29 ft 4 in ) at deep load . They displaced 36 @ , @ 500 long tons ( 37 @ , @ 100 t ) at deep load , roughly 650 long tons ( 660 t ) more than the preceding class . Their crew consisted of 1 @ , @ 360 officers and enlisted men . They had a met ##acentric height of 1 @ . @ 737 metres ( 5 ft 8 @ . @ 4 in ) at deep load .
During the ships ' modernization during the 1930s , their forward superst ##ruct ##ures were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their trip ##od forem ##asts . Both ships were also given torpedo bul ##ges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour . In addition , their stern ##s were lengthened by 7 @ . @ 62 metres ( 25 @ . @ 0 ft ) . These changes increased their overall length to 213 @ . @ 8 metres ( 701 ft ) , their beam to 31 @ . @ 75 metres ( 104 ft 2 in ) and their draft to 9 @ . @ 45 metres ( 31 ft 0 in ) . Their displacement increased over 5 @ , @ 000 long tons ( 5 @ , @ 100 t ) to 42 @ , @ 00 ##1 long tons ( 42 @ , @ 675 t ) at deep load . The crew now numbered 1 @ , @ 376 officers and enlisted men .
= = = Propulsion = = =
The I ##se @ - @ class ships had two sets of direct @ - @ drive steam turbines , each of which drove two propeller shafts with 3 @ . @ 429 @ - @ metre ( 11 ft 3 in ) propellers . The high @ - @ pressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the low @ - @ pressure turbines drove the inner shafts . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 40 @ , @ 000 or 45 @ , @ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @ , @ 000 or 34 @ , @ 000 kW ) ( Hy ##ū ##ga and I ##se respectively ) , using steam provided by 24 Kamp ##on Ro G ##ō water @ - @ tube boilers at working pressures of 13 – 16 @ . @ 9 kg / cm ##2 ( 1 @ , @ 275 – 1 @ , @ 65 ##7 kPa ; 185 – 240 psi ) . Both ships comfortably exceeded their designed speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) during their sea trials ; I ##se reached 23 @ . @ 6 knots ( 43 @ . @ 7 km / h ; 27 @ . @ 2 mph ) from 56 @ , @ 49 ##8 shp ( 42 @ , @ 131 kW ) and Hy ##ū ##ga exceeded that with 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) from 63 @ , @ 211 shp ( 47 @ , @ 136 kW ) . Each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil and the ships had a st ##ow ##age capacity of 4 @ , @ 60 ##7 long tons ( 4 @ , @ 68 ##1 t ) of coal and 1 @ , @ 411 long tons ( 1 @ , @ 43 ##4 t ) of fuel oil , which gave them a range of 9 @ , @ 680 nautical miles ( 17 @ , @ 930 km ; 11 @ , @ 140 mi ) at a speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . I ##se and Hy ##ū ##ga had three generators of 150 kilowatts ( 200 hp ) capacity and two 250 @ - @ kilow ##att ( 340 hp ) turbo generators at 225 vol ##ts .
During their 1930s modernization , the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new Kamp ##on oil @ - @ fired boilers , fitted into the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed . The turbines were replaced by four geared Kamp ##on turbines with a designed output of 80 @ , @ 000 shp ( 60 @ , @ 000 kW ) intended to increase their speed to 24 @ . @ 5 knots ( 45 @ . @ 4 km / h ; 28 @ . @ 2 mph ) . On her trials , I ##se reached a top speed of 25 @ . @ 26 knots ( 46 @ . @ 78 km / h ; 29 @ . @ 07 mph ) from 81 @ , @ 050 shp ( 60 @ , @ 440 kW ) . The fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of 5 @ , @ 113 long tons ( 5 @ , @ 195 t ) of fuel oil that gave them a range of 7 @ , @ 870 nautical miles ( 14 @ , @ 580 km ; 9 @ , @ 060 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) .
= = = Armament = = =
The twelve 45 @ - @ calibre 35 @ . @ 6 cm ( 14 @ . @ 0 in ) Type 41 guns of the I ##se class were mounted in three pairs of twin @ - @ gun , superfiring turrets . N ##umbered one through six from front to rear , each turret weighed 65 ##5 long tons ( 666 t ) . The hydraul ##ically powered turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 / + 20 degrees . The guns had a rate of fire of 1 @ . @ 5 – 2 rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle between - 3 and + 20 degrees . In 1921 the elevation was increased to + 30 degrees and then to + 43 degrees during their mid @ - @ 1930s modernization , except for No . 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered . The rec ##oil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a pneum ##atic system , which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns .
By World War II , the guns used Type 91 armour @ - @ piercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed 67 ##3 @ . @ 5 kilograms ( 1 @ , @ 485 lb ) and was fired at a muzzle velocity of 770 – 77 ##5 metres per second ( 2 @ , @ 530 – 2 @ , @ 540 ft / s ) . They had a maximum range of 25 @ , @ 000 metres ( 27 @ , @ 000 yd ) at + 20 degrees of elevation and 35 @ , @ 450 meters ( 38 @ , @ 770 yd ) at + 43 degrees after modernization . Also available was a 625 @ - @ kilogram ( 1 @ , @ 378 lb ) high @ - @ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 metres per second ( 2 @ , @ 640 ft / s ) . A special Type 3 Sans ##h ##ik ##idan incendiary sh ##rap ##nel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @ - @ aircraft use .
The ships ' secondary armament consisted of twenty 50 @ - @ calibre 14 @ - @ centimet ##re Type 3 . Eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields . They had a maximum elevation of + 20 degrees which gave them ranges of 16 @ , @ 300 metres ( 17 @ , @ 800 yd ) . Each gun had a rate of fire of up to 10 rounds per minute . Anti @ - @ aircraft defence was provided by four 40 @ - @ calibre 3rd Year Type 8 @ - @ centimet ##re AA guns in single mounts . The 7 @ . @ 62 @ - @ centimet ##re ( 3 in ) high @ - @ angle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . They fired a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) projectile with a muzzle velocity of 680 m / s ( 2 @ , @ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 7 @ , @ 500 metres ( 24 @ , @ 600 ft ) . The ships were also fitted with six submerged 53 @ . @ 3 @ - @ centimet ##re ( 21 @ . @ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , three on each broadside . They carried twelve to eighteen 6th Year Type torpedoes which had a 200 @ - @ kilogram ( 440 lb ) warhead . They had three settings for range and speed : 15 @ , @ 000 metres ( 16 @ , @ 000 yd ) at 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , 10 @ , @ 000 metres ( 11 @ , @ 000 yd ) at 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , or 7 @ , @ 000 metres ( 7 @ , @ 700 yd ) at 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) .
In 1931 – 33 the AA guns were replaced with eight 40 @ - @ caliber 12 @ . @ 7 cm ( 5 @ . @ 0 in ) Type 89 dual @ - @ purpose guns , fitted on both sides of the forward superst ##ruct ##ures in four twin @ - @ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @ , @ 700 metres ( 16 @ , @ 100 yd ) ; they had a ceiling of 9 @ , @ 440 metres ( 30 @ , @ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two twin @ - @ gun mounts for license @ - @ built Vickers two @ - @ pounder light AA guns were also added . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 80 degrees and a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute . The pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time .
During the mid @ - @ 1930s reconstruction the torpedo tubes were removed and the Vickers two @ - @ pounders were replaced by twenty license @ - @ built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in 10 twin @ - @ gun mounts . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark St ##ille , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . These 25 @ - @ millimetre ( 0 @ . @ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @ , @ 500 – 3 @ , @ 000 metres ( 1 @ , @ 600 – 3 @ , @ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @ , @ 500 metres ( 18 @ , @ 000 ft ) at an elevation of 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @ - @ round magazines . In addition the forward pair of 14 cm guns in the forecastle were removed at this time and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to + 30 degrees .

The I ##se @ - @ class ships ' waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of 299 mm ( 11 @ . @ 8 in ) of Vickers cemented armour amidships ; below it was a str ##ake of 100 mm ( 3 @ . @ 9 in ) armour . The upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high @ - @ tens ##ile steel 55 mm ( 2 @ . @ 2 in ) thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high @ - @ tens ##ile steel , but only 30 mm ( 1 @ . @ 2 in ) thick . The sides of this deck sl ##oped downwards to meet the bottom of the lower str ##ake of the belt armour . The ends of the belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that ranged in thickness from 203 to 102 mm ( 8 to 4 in ) . The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of 254 mm ( 10 in ) on the face and 76 mm on the roof . The casemate armour was 149 mm ( 5 @ . @ 9 in ) thick and that of the barbettes was 299 mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm . The sides of the conning tower were 305 mm thick .
The I ##se class were the only Japanese battleships to place the powder magazine above the shell magazine as the IJN wished to put as much space as possible between the highly flamm ##able propellant and mine and torpedo deton ##ations . The danger from plung ##ing shells at long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three British battlecruisers during the 1916 Battle of Jutland graph ##ically demonstrated the point . To further protect the magazines the depth of the double bottom was increased to a total of 3 @ . @ 58 metres ( 11 ft 9 in ) underneath the barbettes and magazines . Additionally , the vessels contained 660 watertight compartments to preserve buoyancy in the event of battle damage . In addition to the torpedo bulge added when the ships were modernized , the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness of 140 mm . Inside the original skin of the ships , two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total of 152 millimetres ( 6 in ) of armour .

These were felt to be inferior to the British Barr & Stroud instruments used on other ships and were removed in 1920 . They were replaced by either the British rangef ##inders or domestically built instruments of 6 or 8 metres ( 19 ft 8 in or 26 ft 3 in ) length . In the late 1920s the fire @ - @ control systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the forem ##ast to accommodate them . A pair of directors for the 12 @ . @ 7 cm AA guns were added , one on each side of the forward superstructure , in the early 1930s . The fire @ - @ control systems were again upgraded in the mid @ - @ 1930s and directors were added for the 25 mm AA guns . Both ships had 10 @ - @ metre ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangef ##inders installed at the top of the pag ##oda mast at that time . Type 21 air @ - @ search radars were installed aboard the sisters in mid @ - @ 1942 .

I ##se was briefly fitted with an aircraft flying @ - @ off platform for a Mitsubishi 1 ##M ##F ##3 fighter on Tur ##ret No . 2 in 1927 . It was replaced by a platform on Tur ##ret No . 5 for a Yokosuka E ##1 ##Y reconnaissance float ##plane in 1928 – 29 . A catapult and a collaps ##ible 4 @ - @ ton ##ne ( 3 @ . @ 9 @ - @ long @ - @ ton ) crane were fitted on the stern during the mid @ - @ 1930s modernization , and the ships were equipped to operate three float ##planes , although no hangar was provided . The initial Nakajima E4 ##N ##2 bipl ##anes were replaced by Nakajima E ##8 ##N ##2 bipl ##anes in 1938 .

The sinking of the British capital ships Prince of Wales and Rep ##ulse by Japanese land @ - @ based aircraft on 10 December 1941 led the IJN to realize that battleships could not operate in the face of enemy aircraft and required friendly air support to protect them . The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June 1942 severely limited the ability of the IJN to provide any air cover and alternatives were sought . Earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected at the beginning of the war , but they were revived after Midway . Plans for more elaborate conversions were rejected on the grounds of expense and , most critically , time , and the IJN settled on removing the rear pair of turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with two catap ##ults to launch float ##planes . The I ##se @ - @ class ships were selected for the conversion because Hy ##ū ##ga had suffered an explosion in Tur ##ret No . 5 in early May that virtually destroyed the turret and their Tur ##ret No . 6 could not elevate to the full + 43 degrees deemed necessary for the long @ - @ range engagement anticipated by the IJN . The Fus ##ō ##s were scheduled to follow once the first two were completed .

The rear turrets , the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour . All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off . Four additional twin 12 @ . @ 7 cm mounts were added , one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower . The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added , a total of 57 guns . Two each Type 94 and Type 95 AA directors were added to control the additional guns . The ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the 14 cm guns and for Tur ##ret No . 5 . During 1944 , the ships ' AA defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25 mm gun mounts , for a total of 104 barrels , and a pair of Type 13 early warning radars were added . In September six 30 @ - @ round AA rocket launchers were added on the sides of the flight deck .
= = = Flight deck arrangements = = =
A 70 @ - @ metre @ - @ long ( 229 ft 8 in ) flight deck was built above the stern and stretched forward to the rebuilt aft superstructure . The flight deck was 29 metres ( 95 ft 2 in ) wide at its forward end and 13 metres ( 42 ft 8 in ) at the stern . It overh ##ung the stern and increased the overall length of the ships to 219 @ . @ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) . A pair of rotating gunpowder @ - @ propelled catap ##ults were fitted on the sides of the hull , forward of the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc of fire of the two amidships turrets . They could launch aircraft up to 4 @ , @ 600 kilograms ( 10 @ , @ 100 lb ) in weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft . The flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to the catap ##ults and the hydraul ##ically operated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trol ##leys used to move the float ##planes about . Two aircraft were intended to be st ##owed on the catap ##ults and three more in temporary positions on the flight deck for a total of thirteen .
The 40 @ - @ metre @ - @ long ( 131 ft 3 in ) hangar was 20 metres ( 65 ft 7 in ) wide forward and 11 metres ( 36 ft 1 in ) at the rear . It was 6 metres ( 19 ft 8 in ) high and designed to st ##ow nine aircraft . It was fitted with fire fighting foam and carbon dioxide disp ##ens ##ers as a result of wartime experience . The ' T ' - shaped lift was 12 @ . @ 1 metres ( 39 ft 8 in ) wide at its forward end and 6 @ . @ 6 metres ( 21 ft 8 in ) wide at the its aft end . It was 12 @ . @ 1 metres long and had a capacity of 6 tonnes ( 5 @ . @ 9 long tons ) . Pet ##rol storage tanks with a capacity of 76 tonnes ( 75 long tons ) were installed in the former magazine of Tur ##ret No . 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for three sorties . To recover the aircraft the collaps ##ible crane formerly on the stern was moved up to the port side of the flight deck . Another crane was intended on the starboard side , but it was never fitted .
The ships had an air group of 11 each of Yokosuka D ##4 ##Y dive bombers ( Allied reporting name " Judy " ) and A ##ichi E ##16 ##A reconnaissance aircraft ( Allied reporting name " Paul " ) Both aircraft had development problems and neither air group ever had all of its intended aircraft . Cou ##pled with a shortage of trained pilots , neither ship ever used its aircraft during combat .
= = = Other changes = = =
After the loss of the fast battleship H ##iei at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in late 1942 to rudder damage , the IJN decided to reinforce the protection of the steering compartment and to create an auxiliary steering compartment . The protection of the former was strengthened by the addition of a concrete wall at least 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) in thickness and some of the armour removed from the turrets was used to protect the latter . The double bottom below the former positions of aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil ; this increased the ships ' endurance to 9 @ , @ 500 nautical miles ( 17 @ , @ 600 km ; 10 @ , @ 900 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots . A pair of Type 22 surface @ - @ search radars were also fitted during the conversion .
The removal of the secondary armament , the rear turrets and their supporting structures was generally compensated by the addition of the flight deck , hangar , AA guns and more fuel , and the met ##acentric height increased . 23 metres ( 9 @ . @ 1 in ) to 2 @ . @ 81 metres ( 9 ft 3 in ) at full load as a result of the reduction in the displacement by over 2 @ , @ 000 tonnes ( 2 @ , @ 000 long tons ) to 40 @ , @ 444 tonnes ( 39 @ , @ 805 long tons ) . This also reduced the draught to 9 @ . @ 03 metres ( 29 ft 8 in ) . The over ##hang of the flight deck at the stern increased the overall length to 219 @ . @ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) and the beam was slightly reduced to 31 @ . @ 71 metres ( 104 ft 0 in ) .

Upon commissioning , the sister ships were assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . Hy ##ū ##ga had an explosion in one of her main gun turrets that killed 11 men and injured 25 in 1919 ; the following year she accidentally collided with and sank a schooner , losing two crewmen . Before the start of the Pacific War , both ships frequently exercised off the coasts of the Soviet Union , Korea and China in addition to training in Japanese waters . I ##se hosted Edward , Prince of Wales , and his aide @ - @ de @ - @ camp Lieutenant Louis Mountbatten in 1922 during the prince ' s visit to Japan . In Korea Bay when the 1923 Great Kant ##ō earthquake struck , they sailed to Ky ##ushu where they loaded supplies from for the victims on 4 September . Together with two other battleships and a pair of light cruisers , I ##se sank the destroyer Y ##ay ##oi in 1926 during gunnery practice . I ##se ' s AA armament was upgraded in 1931 and Hy ##ū ##ga ' s two years later . The latter ship was modernized in 1934 – 36 and I ##se in 1935 – 37 , both at Kure Naval Arsenal . During the Second Sino @ - @ Japanese War , the sisters frequently patrolled the Chinese coast in support of the blockade imposed by Japan . In August 1937 Hy ##ū ##ga fer ##ried two battalions of Special Naval Landing Forces to Port Arthur . Three years later , she served as the flagship for the Emperor of the puppet state of Manch ##uk ##uo , Henry Pu @ - @ y ##i , during his state visit to Japan in June 1940 . On 15 November the ships were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . The sisters were refitted in late 1940 in preparation for war , which included the fitting of external deg ##aus ##sing co ##ils and additional AA directors .

When Japan began the Pacific War on 8 December , the sisters sortied for the Bon ##in Islands with four other battleships and the light carrier Hō ##sh ##ō as distant cover for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . On 11 March 1942 I ##se and Hy ##ū ##ga sortied from their anchorage at Hash ##ir ##ajima to join the unsuccessful search for the American carrier force that had attacked Marcus Island a week earlier . Similarly they pursued but did not catch the American carriers that had launched the Doolittle Raid on 18 April .
During gunnery training on 5 May , there was a premature detonation in the left gun of Hy ##ū ##ga ' s Tur ##ret No . 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen . Both aft magazines were flooded to d ##ouse the resulting fire and save the ship . She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25 mm gun mounts were positioned . On 11 May a valve in I ##se ' s No . 2 engine room stuck in the open position and flooded the engine room . While under repair at Kure , both ships received prototype Type 21 radars . Comm ##anded by Vice @ - @ Admiral Shir ##ō Tak ##asu , the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May , at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island ( Operation MI ) .
They returned home on 14 June and the IJN began preliminary planning to replace the lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships . The sisters were selected for conversion and detached from the division on 14 July in preparation . They remained on " standby alert " until the actual conversions began . I ##se was converted at Kure Naval Arsenal from 23 February to 5 September 1943 and Hy ##ū ##ga at Sas ##ebo Naval Arsenal from 2 May to 30 November .
After completing her sea trials , I ##se was attached to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Et ##ajima and fer ##ried troops and munitions to the naval base at Truk in October . In November the ship began working up , joined by the newly completed Hy ##ū ##ga the following month , and both rejoined the 2nd Battleship Division . On 1 May 1944 , the sisters were transferred to Rear Admiral Mats ##uda Chi ##aki ' s reformed Fourth Carrier Division of the 3rd Fleet . The division ' s 63 ##4 ##th Naval Air Group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late June .
= = = = Battle of Cape Eng ##a ##ño = = = =
Short ##ages of aircraft and service ##ability problems greatly ret ##arded pilot training and the ships only had a total of 17 D ##4 ##Y ##s and 18 E ##16 ##As on hand on 1 October ; of these , only 6 and 16 were operational , respectively . The Japanese plan for the defence of the Philippines envisioned that the surviving carriers would be used to lure the American carrier forces away from the invasion area to a position where the carriers could be attacked by land @ - @ based aircraft and the transports by the rest of the IJN . The other carrier air groups were not in much better shape and the Japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the American carriers . The Fourth Carrier Division was assigned to the Northern Force under the command of Vice Admiral J ##is ##ab ##ur ##ō Oz ##awa and the sisters sailed from Yash ##ima on 20 October . On the morning of 24 October , the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the American carriers as a distraction . They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked . The Americans finally spotted the Japanese carriers at 16 : 40 , some 200 miles ( 320 km ) east of Cape Eng ##a ##ño , the northeastern tip of Luzon . The American carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an airstri ##ke , so Admiral William Halsey , commander of the Third Fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning . Oz ##awa reversed course during the night , correctly believing that the Americans would follow him north .
Although they had lost contact during the night , the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07 : 35 . They had already launched an airstri ##ke of 180 aircraft that was orbiting 50 miles ( 80 km ) ahead of the American carriers while waiting for the Japanese ships to be located . This was just the first of a total of five airstri ##kes that the Americans launched that day . The sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstri ##kes which are focusing on the group ' s aircraft carriers . I ##se claimed to have shot down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated on Tur ##ret No . 2 . Hy ##ū ##ga was lightly damaged by near misses that rupture some hull plating in her bulge and pepper her superstructure with splin ##ters . She took on a 5 @ - @ degree list that was quickly corrected before she was ordered to tow the crippled carrier Ch ##iy ##oda to safety . Her attempt was unsuccessful and Ch ##iy ##oda had to be abandoned to her fate .
I ##se was attacked by 80 @ - @ odd aircraft from the fourth wave , but they failed to inflict any serious damage . She dod ##ged 11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once , on the bulge out ##board of the port catapult . Some 34 other bombs near missed her , spr ##aying her with splin ##ters and rupt ##ured some hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms . While an exact total of her casualties is not available , it has been estimated that 5 men were killed and some 111 – 121 crewmen were wounded during this attack . Hy ##ū ##ga was unsuccessfully attacked by an American submarine at 18 : 43 . Around 19 : 00 Oz ##awa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank Ch ##iy ##oda . He ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans , but the battleships were unable to find them , and Oz ##awa ordered them to reverse course and head for Am ##ami Ō ##shima . When they arrived on 27 October , Oz ##awa transferred to Hy ##ū ##ga and hoisted his flag aboard her . While en route for Kure , the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine .
In early November the catap ##ults were removed from both ships , and they loaded troops and munitions later that month . While en route they were diverted to the Spr ##at ##ly Islands upon reports of heavy air raids at Manila . After off @ - @ loading their cargo , they sailed for Ling ##ga Island , near Singapore , on 20 November . They transferred to Cam Ran ##h Bay , French Indochina and Hy ##ū ##ga became flagship of the 5th Fleet there on 14 December . The division sailed for Singapore on 30 December and Vice Admiral K ##iy ##oh ##ide Sh ##ima transferred his flag to the light cruiser Ō ##y ##odo on arrival there the following day . The division continued onwards to Ling ##ga . Its planned return to Japan was delayed by attacks by the American Third Fleet on targets in Indochina and southern China that sank two oil tankers that were intended to refuel the division .
The IJN then decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol , rubber , tin and other strategic minerals back to Japan after the American carriers departed the South China Sea ( Operation K ##ita ) . They loaded their cargo ##es beginning on 6 February at Singapore and departed four days later . Also carrying some 1 @ , @ 150 oil ##field workers , they were escorted by Ō ##y ##odo and three destroyers . Dec ##ry ##pted Japanese radio signals revealed the Japanese plan to the Allies , and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships . An additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route , but only three were ultimately able to attack . None of them were successful before the Japanese reached Kure on 20 February . The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships . On 19 March Kure was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and Hy ##ū ##ga was hit three times by bombs that killed 37 men and wounded 52 . Her gunners claimed to have shot down one American dive bomber during the attack . I ##se was hit twice during the attack , but her casualties , if any , are unknown .
The ships were turned into floating AA batteries over the next several months although it av ##ailed them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July . On the 24th I ##se was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times ; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded . The bombs started numerous leaks and I ##se began to settle by the bow , although she was returned to an even keel after three @ - @ days pumping . Hy ##ū ##ga was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses . She was badly damaged with some 200 @ - @ odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack . She slowly found ##ered over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later . This time it was I ##se ' s turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list . The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their w ##recks were scrapped after the war .

Richard Gale " Dick " Rif ##enburg ( August 21 , 1926 – December 5 , 1994 ) was an American football player and a pioneering television broadcaster for the forerunner to W ##IV ##B @ - @ TV in Buffalo . He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 1944 and from 1946 to 1948 . He was a consensus selection at end on the 1948 College Football All @ - @ America Team .

He hosted various television and radio sports shows and was eventually inducted into the Buffalo Broad ##c ##asters Hall of Fame .
In college , he led the Big Ten Conference in single season receptions during his senior year and set Michigan Wolverines receptions records for both career touchdown and single @ - @ season touchdowns . He had also been a Michigan High School Athletic Association ( M ##HS ##AA ) state champion in both basketball and track and field . His college career was interrupted by World War II service , and his high school career was also affected by the war due to the M ##HS ##AA ' s cancellation of state championships in all sports in 1943 .
= = High school = =
Rif ##enburg was born in Pet ##os ##key , Michigan , and raised in Kalamazoo , Michigan before his family moved to Saginaw , Michigan . Rif ##enburg was a star athlete at Saginaw ' s Arthur Hill High School in football , basketball , and track and field . In 1943 , Michigan canceled boys high school tournaments in all sports due to World War II , and they did not return until the fall of 1944 . In 1944 , he led Arthur Hill High to the M ##HS ##AA Class A high school basketball championship ( over Kalamazoo Central High School ) , scoring 24 points , including 17 in the second half , of the championship game . Rif ##enburg was also the state champion in 1944 in both the shot put 46 feet 11 inches ( 14 @ . @ 30 m ) and high jump 5 feet 8 @ . @ 5 inches ( 1 @ . @ 74 m ) . He also led Arthur Hill in football , and his high school accomplishments are featured in Glory : The history of Saginaw County sports by Jack T ##any ( AS ##IN B ##000 ##6 ##R ##H ##9 ##Z ##6 ) , which is a book on high school sports in Saginaw County , Michigan . Rif ##enburg was named All State in football , basketball and track .
It is ironic that Rif ##enburg was born in Pet ##os ##key , Michigan in 1926 for several reasons . Ted Pet ##os ##key preceded Rif ##enburg as an All @ - @ American end on the University of Michigan football team . Pet ##os ##key had excelled as a representative of Saginaw County in M ##HS ##AA competition . Pet ##os ##key posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well . Achie ##ving All @ - @ American status as an end at Michigan would be Rif ##enburg ' s next step after exc ##elling in M ##HS ##AA competition .

In the fall of 1944 , Rif ##enburg enrolled at the University of Michigan . The United Press syndicate ran a feature article about Rif ##enburg in September 1944 that opened as follows : " Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick Rif ##enburg , 18 @ - @ year @ - @ old Michigan freshman . Every so often a great offensive end comes along , a player who has to learn how to play defense , but who has the natural speed , smooth actions , height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver . Rif ##enburg has laid claim to that rating . A loose @ - @ lim ##bed 180 @ - @ pound freshman from Saginaw , Mich . , Rif ##enberg is being boom ##ed as the Big Ten ' s next ' freshman sensation . ' " As a freshman , he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa . In an article titled " Te ##ens and TNT , " Time reported on Rif ##enburg ' s performance : " Of the few teams already in action , Michigan ' s teens rang the freshman bell loud ##est last week by winning their opener , 12 - to @ - @ 7 , against the strong Iowa Seahawks ( Naval Pre @ - @ Flight ) ; 6 @ - @ ft . 4 Freshman End Dick Rif ##enburg caught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns . "
Rif ##enburg ' s college career was interrupted by World War II service in the United States Navy , but after missing the 1945 season , he returned to play for the Wolverines from 1946 to 1948 . Rif ##enburg played for the Wolverines in consecutive undefeated National Championship seasons in 1947 and 1948 . He started nine games for the 1947 team . The 1947 team referred to as " Michigan ' s Mad Mag ##icians " is considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time . Rif ##enberg and teammate Len Ford had the reputation as the team practical jok ##ers . During the 1947 game against Wisconsin , Rif ##enburg started calling signals for the Bad ##gers . Wisconsin ' s offense protested to officials , who " prow ##led the Wolverines secondary but never caught their man . " Rif ##enburg continued to sc ##ramble Bad ##ger signals , as Rif ##enburg ' s teammates laughed at his scheme . In the January 1 , 1948 Rose Bowl that season , Michigan rolled to a 49 – 0 victory over USC , and they outg ##ained the Trojans 49 ##1 yards to 133 . Rif ##enburg caught a 29 @ - @ yard pass for the game ' s final score .
In the 1948 championship season , Rif ##enburg scored eight touchdowns , caught 22 passes , and gained 610 yards ( 50 ##8 receiving and 102 rushing ) . Rif ##enburg was the second highest scoring end in the nation in 1948 , and he was a consensus All @ - @ American as a senior , being selected as first team on nine of the 11 All @ - @ American teams . Rif ##enburg led the Big Ten in receptions .
Although Rif ##enburg finished fourth among mid ##western Heisman voters in 1948 , he did not finish among the top eight . By comparison , Notre Dame end Leon Hart won the Heisman Trophy in 1949 but made only eight of the 11 All @ - @ American teams . It is not clear why Rif ##enburg did not finish higher . However , it is fairly clear that sports ##writers of that era had a bias against Michigan . In the Associated Press poll at the end of the 1947 season , the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were ranked ahead of the University of Michigan , though both teams were undefeated . Some noted that every Southern AP voter had voted for Notre Dame , which had yet to integrate , whereas three of Michigan ' s star players ( Bob Mann , Gene Der ##ric ##otte , and Len Ford ) were African @ - @ American . The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played African @ - @ American players .
Rif ##enburg was considered one of the greatest Wolverine ' s of the 1940s . In four seasons with the Michigan Wolverines , Rif ##enburg played in 32 games and had over 1 @ , @ 000 yards of total offense . Rif ##enburg held the University of Michigan ' s single season and career record for touchdown receptions ( eight in a season ; sixteen career ) until his records were broken by Anthony Carter in 1980 .

In 1948 , Rif ##enburg was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 15th round of the NFL draft , and he was also drafted by the New York Yankees of the All @ - @ America Football Conference . He had intended to play in 1949 with the Yankees , but suffered a knee injury in a practice session for the August 1949 Chicago College All @ - @ Star Game . Press accounts at the time noted that the injury " will probably keep him out of pro football all season , if not forever . " The incident led to a debate as to whether NFL owners should " bar their men from playing with the college all @ - @ stars . "
Rif ##enburg landed a job at W ##J ##R radio in Detroit , but he left his sports ##caster ' s job to join the Detroit Lions . In the 1950 NFL season , Rif ##enburg came back from his injury to play for the Detroit Lions . He played in 12 games and had ten receptions for 96 yards and one touchdown for the 1950 Lions . Rif ##enburg recalled that his playing time with the Lions was limited because the Lions also signed 1949 Heisman Trophy winner Leon Hart , who played the same position .
In May 1951 , he announced he was retiring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in Buffalo . He was hired as a sports ##caster by WB ##EN ( now known as W ##IV ##B ) , which had just started the first television station in Buffalo and the only one serving Southern Ontario . This was an early foray into television by the Buffalo Evening News . In the 1950s , Rif ##enburg hosted a popular panel show called " Let ' s Talk Sports " in Buffalo and also pioneered an early morning exercise program . He also worked for WB ##EN ( AM ) and WB ##EN ( FM ) and as the sid ##eline announcer for Buffalo Bills games along with Van Miller , the long time Bills play @ - @ by @ - @ play announcer . In addition , he served as the play @ - @ by @ - @ play announcer for the University of Buffalo Bulls football team . As a radio broadcaster , he is remembered for things ranging from ski reports , to 17 years worth of " Break ##fast At — " programs live from various local restaurants , to 27 years as the WB ##EN @ - @ AM All Night Show host .
After 30 years with WB ##EN and a change in ownership for the station , his show was replaced with the Mutual Network ' s The Larry King Show . In the 1980s , Rif ##enburg taught communications at Buffalo ' s Med ##aille College and served as a disc jockey on Public Broadcasting ' s radio station W ##E ##B ##R ( now W ##DC ##Z ) . He also sold ads for Buffalo Evening News competitor , Buffalo Courier @ - @ Express .

Rif ##enburg was posthumously inducted into the Buffalo Broad ##c ##asters Hall of Fame in September 2007 . He was given the Golden Age Award which is reserved for " those who did it first , the people who had no pattern to follow . " The Hall of Fame award was presented to Rif ##enburg ' s wife , Jane .

The 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane was the second @ - @ most intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season . The eleventh tropical storm , fifth hurricane , and the third major hurricane of the season , it formed east @ - @ northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 31 . The tropical storm moved rapidly west @ - @ northwestward , steadily intensifying to a hurricane . It acquired peak winds of 140 miles per hour ( 225 km / h ) and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3 , including Ele ##uther ##a and Harbour Island , causing severe damage to crops , buildings , and infrastructure . Winds over 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) affected many islands in its path , especially those that encountered its center , and many wh ##ar ##ves were ruined .
Subsequently , it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter , Florida , early on September 4 with winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . The hurricane moved across the state , passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating . In Florida , the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations , and numerous trees were prost ##rated in citrus gro ##ves . The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction , and Stuart , Jupiter , and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged . Inland , the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prod ##igious amounts of rain , causing a dam to collapse near Tampa . The storm caused $ 3 million in damage ( 1933 USD ) after damaging or destroying 6 @ , @ 84 ##8 homes .
Unus ##ually , the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125 @ - @ mile @ - @ per @ - @ hour ( 201 km / h ) winds struck South Texas ; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession .
= = Meteorological history = =
The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on August 27 , although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west @ - @ northwest . On August 31 , a nearby ship reported gale force winds , which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east @ - @ northeast of the Lesser Antilles . Based on continuity , it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day . Moving quickly to the west @ - @ northwest , the storm passed north of the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico . Early on September 2 , a ship called the Gulf ##wing reported a barometric pressure of 978 mbar ( 28 @ . @ 88 inHg ) , which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status . After passing north of the Turks and Ca ##icos islands , the hurricane struck Ele ##uther ##a and Harbour Island in the Bahamas on September 3 , the latter at 1100 UTC . A station on the latter island reported a pressure of 27 @ . @ 90 inHg ( 94 ##5 mb ) during the 30 minute passage of the eye . Based on the pressure and the small size of the storm , it is estimated the hurricane struck Harbour Island with peak winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) , making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @ - @ Simpson scale . Inter ##p ##olation suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status , or Category 3 status , on September 2 .
The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late August , which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas . This hurricane instead maintained a general west @ - @ northwest track . After moving through the northern Bahamas , the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at Jupiter , Florida , at 05 ##00 UTC on September 4 . A station there reported a pressure of 27 @ . @ 98 inHg ( 94 ##8 mb ) during a 40 minute period of the eye ' s passage ; this suggested a landfall strength of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . At the time , the radius of maximum winds was 15 mi ( 24 km ) , which was smaller than average . After landfall , the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state . It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September 5 . A few hours later while continuing to the northwest , it made another landfall near Ros ##ewood — a ghost town in Levy County , east of Cedar Key — with winds of about 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . Turning to the north , the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia , dissipating on September 7 near Augusta .

On September 2 , a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End , Grand Bah ##ama , to Daytona Beach , Florida . While the storm was near peak intensity on September 3 , the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne , Florida , with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville . Later that day , storm warnings , were issued from Key West to Cedar Key . About 2 @ , @ 500 people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee . By evening on September 3 , high tides sent sea spray over coastal seaw ##alls in Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings ; structures on Cle ##mat ##is Street in West Palm Beach were said to be a " solid front " of p ##lywood . Along the coast , observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land .
The powerful hurricane moved over or near several islands in the Bahamas . Winds on Spanish Wells and Harbour Island were both estimated at around 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) . Winds reached 110 mph ( 177 km / h ) at Governor ' s Harbour , 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) on Ele ##uther ##a , and 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) on the Ab ##aco Islands . The storm was farther away from Nassau , where winds reached 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) . The hurricane damaged a lumber mill on Ab ##aco , washing away a dock . Heavy damage occurred on Harbour Island , including to several roofs , the walls of government buildings , and the water system . The hurricane destroyed four churches and 37 houses , leaving 100 people homeless . A 1 @ . @ 5 mi ( 2 @ . @ 4 km ) road on Ele ##uther ##a was destroyed . Several islands sustained damage to farms , including the total loss of various fruit trees on Russell Island . Despite Category 4 winds on Spanish Wells , only five houses were destroyed , although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs . Collect ##ively between North Point , James C ##is ##tern , and Gregory Town on Ele ##uther ##a , the storm destroyed 55 houses and damaged many others . On Grand Bah ##ama , where a 9 to 12 ft ( 2 @ . @ 7 to 3 @ . @ 7 m ) storm surge was reported , half of the houses were destroyed , as were 13 boats and two planes , and most docks were wrecked .
When the storm moved ashore in Florida , winds reached an estimated 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) in Jupiter ; these occurred after the eye passed . In West Palm Beach , an ##em ##ometers measured at least 80 @ - @ mile @ - @ per @ - @ hour ( 129 km / h ) winds with gusts to 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) ; bar ##ometers ranged from 28 @ . @ 64 to 28 @ . @ 78 inHg ( 970 to 975 mb ) . The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . Winds were not as strong farther from the center ; 40 to 45 mph ( 64 to 72 km / h ) winds were observed in Miami to the south , Titus ##ville to the north , and Tampa on the west coast . Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of 80 to 90 mph ( 129 to 145 km / h ) , and pressures d ##ipped to 29 @ . @ 14 inHg ( 98 ##7 mb ) . Inland , winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 17 @ . @ 8 in ( 450 mm ) in Cl ##erm ##ont .
At West Palm Beach , the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation . Several coconut and royal palms that with ##stood the 1928 hurricane snapped , litter ##ing streets with broken trunks . Winds downed road signs on many streets , and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course . Some gar ##ages and isolated structures , mostly lightweight , were partly or totally destroyed , along with a lumber warehouse . Some homes that lost roof ##ing sh ##ing ##les had water damage to their interiors as well . Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive break ##age of windows , including plate glass , and loss of tile and sh ##ingle roof ##ing , but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars , and no post @ - @ storm accidents took place . Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city , and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted . As in Lake Worth , officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and string ##ent building codes with reducing overall damage . The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926 , 1928 , and 1929 . High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lag ##oon . Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage , except to vegetation , and county properties went largely unscathed .
In Martin and St . Luc ##ie counties , the storm was considered among the worst on record . The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations . At Stuart , winds removed or badly damaged 75 % of the roofs in town . The storm destroyed the third floor of the building that housed a bowling alley and the Stuart News , a local newspaper . At Olympia , an abandoned settlement also known as Olympia Beach , strong winds leveled the old Olympia Inn , a gas station , and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building . Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant . A bridge leading to the barrier island from Olympia was partly wrecked ; the bridge tender survived by gripping the rail ##ing during the storm . Winds leveled his nearby home . According to the Monthly Weather Review , some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at Olympia . The storm left many homes in Hob ##e Sound unin ##h ##abit ##able , forcing crews to tear them down . Winter estates on the island , however , were better built and little damaged . While Stuart and Hob ##e Sound sustained significant damage , Port Sal ##ern ##o suffered minim ##ally . In Stuart , the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless , up to nearly 10 % of the population , which was 5 @ , @ 100 at the time . Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce , the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines . In the latter city , high waves washed out a portion of the causeway . In the 1980s , an elderly resident recalled that the storm was the most severe on record in Fort Pierce .
C ##rop damage was worst along the Indian River Lag ##oon ; several farms in Stuart experienced total losses , and statewide , 16 % of the citrus crop , or 4 million boxes , were destroyed . Many chicken co ##ops in Stuart were destroyed , and the local chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as Ind ##iant ##own . Across southeastern Florida , the hurricane damaged 6 @ , @ 465 houses and destroyed another 383 , causing over $ 3 million in damage . One person , an African American farm worker , was killed when his sh ##ack blew down in Gomez , a br ##ak ##eman died after seven rail ##cars der ##ailed , and a child was killed by airborne debris .
High rainfall caused flooding across Florida , notably near Tampa where waters reached 9 ft ( 2 @ . @ 7 m ) deep . High rainfall of over 7 in ( 180 mm ) caused a dam operated by Tampa Electric Co . to break 3 mi ( 4 @ . @ 8 km ) northeast of Tampa along the Hillsborough River . The break resulted in severe local damage , flooding portions of Sul ##phur Springs . Workers attempted to save the dam with sand ##bags , and after the break , most residents in the area were warned of the approaching flood . Over 50 homes were flooded , forcing about 150 people to evacuate . Outside Florida , the storm produced winds of 48 and 51 mph ( 78 and 81 km / h ) in Savannah , Georgia and Charleston , South Carolina , respectively . In the latter city , the storm spawned a tornado , which caused about $ 10 @ , @ 000 in property damage . Heavy rainfall occurred along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts , reaching over 12 in ( 300 mm ) . Light rainfall also extended into North Carolina .

In the Bahamas after the storm , a boat sailed from Nassau to deliver food and building materials to Ele ##uther ##a .
After the storm , the National Guard offered shelters for at least 400 homeless residents in Stuart . Of the 7 @ , @ 900 families adversely affected by the hurricane , 4 @ , @ 325 required assistance from the American Red Cross . Farmers in Texas , also affected by a major hurricane , requested grow ##ers in Florida wait 15 days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell . The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city ' s water treatment plant , and a new dam was eventually built in 1944 .
= Second Battle of Naktong Bul ##ge =
The Second Battle of Naktong Bul ##ge was an engagement between United Nations ( UN ) and North Korean ( NK ) forces early in the Korean War from September 1 to September 15 , 1950 , along the Naktong River in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack .
After the First Battle of Naktong Bul ##ge , the US Army ' s 2nd Infantry Division was moved to defend the Naktong River line . The division , which was unt ##ried in combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People ' s Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division ' s line . The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half , and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Y ##ongsan , promoting a fight there .
The urgency of the threat to Pusan Perimeter prompted the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to be brought in to reinforce the US Army troops . In two weeks of heavy fighting , the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the Naktong Bul ##ge region . The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at Inch ##on , which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army .
= = Background = =
= = = Pusan Perimeter = = =
From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People ' s Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double en ##velopment of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army .
When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the NK 6th Division , and later the NK 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan , initially rep ##elling a UN counter ##offensive before counter ##ing with battles at Kom ##am @ - @ ni and Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of Masan , the NK 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sp ##ar ##red in the Naktong Bul ##ge area . In the First Battle of Naktong Bul ##ge , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the NK 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In the Taegu region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu . Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the NK 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P ' o ##hang @ - @ dong during the Battle of P ' o ##hang @ - @ dong . All along the front , the North Korean troops were reel ##ing from these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were not working .
= = = September push = = =
In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu .
On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @ - @ pr ##ong attack against the UN lines . These attacks would overw ##helm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back . Five battle group ##ings were ordered . The center attack called for the NK 9th Division , NK 4th Division , NK 2nd Division , and NK 10th Division break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Naktong Bul ##ge to Mir ##yang and Y ##ongsan .
= = Battle = =
During the North Koreans ' September 1 offensive , the US 25th Infantry Division ' s US 35th Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle of Nam River north of Masan . On the 35th Regiment ' s right flank , just north of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River , was the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division . There , in the southernmost part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone , the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than 20 @ , @ 000 yards ( 18 @ , @ 000 m ) long , including the bulge area of the Naktong where the First Battle of Naktong Bul ##ge had taken place earlier in August . Each US infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3 @ , @ 000 feet ( 910 m ) to 4 @ , @ 000 feet ( 1 @ , @ 200 m ) and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front .
During the last week of August , US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river , which they thought was North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the Naktong against a possible American attack . There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry ' s forward positions , but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action . On August 31 , the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines . Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming .
On the west side of the Naktong , North Korean Major General Pak K ##yo Sam , commanding the NK 9th Division , issued his operations order to the division on August 28 . Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outfl ##ank and destroy the US troops at Naktong Bul ##ge by capturing the Mir ##yang and Sam ##n ##ang ##jin areas to cut off the US 2nd Division ' s route of supply and withdrawal between Taegu and Pusan . However , the North Koreans weren ' t aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the Naktong River . Consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea . They had only recently been moved into the line . The North Koreans began crossing the Naktong River under cover of darkness at certain points .
= = = Battle of Ag ##ok = = =
On the southern @ - @ most flank of the 9th Infantry river line , just above the junction of the Nam River with the Naktong , A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge paralleling the Naktong that terminates in Hill 94 at the K ##ih ##ang ferry site . The river road from Nam ##ji @ - @ ri running west along the Naktong passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry . A small village called Ag ##ok lay at the base of Hill 94 and 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the river . A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company , 9th Infantry , held a road ##block near the ferry and close to Ag ##ok . On the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking Ag ##ok and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line .
That evening Sergeant Ernest R . Kou ##ma led the patrol of two M2 ##6 Pers ##hing tanks and two M ##19 Gun Motor Car ##riages in Ag ##ok . Kou ##ma placed his patrol on the west side of Ag ##ok near the K ##ih ##ang ferry . At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling on the American @ - @ held side of the river . By 22 : 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company ' s positions . American mortars and artillery began firing counter ##b ##atter ##y . Some of the A Company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and spl ##ashes in the water .
At 22 : 30 the fog lifted and Kou ##ma saw that a North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position . Kou ##ma ' s four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed , and the p ##on ##ton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight fl ##ared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks . This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company road ##block squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise .
Kou ##ma ' s patrol was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms . Kou ##ma was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the Ag ##ok site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank . In the attack against A Company , the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon , which was near Ag ##ok , but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward .
The NK 9th Division ' s infantry crossing of the Naktong and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company , north of A Company . There the North Koreans assaulted in force , signaled by green flares and blowing of wh ##istles . The company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape . Many of the men moved south , a few of them coming into A Company ' s ridge line positions near Ag ##ok during the night . Most of C Company moved all the way to the 25th Division positions south of the Naktong . On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines .
= = = North Korean crossing = = =
Meanwhile , 5 miles ( 8 @ . @ 0 km ) north of Ag ##ok and A Company ' s position , B Company , 9th Infantry , held a similar position on Hill 209 overlooking the P ##aek ##chin ferry crossing of the river . This ferry was located at the middle of the Naktong Bul ##ge where the Y ##ongsan road came down to the Naktong and crossed it . The US 2nd Infantry Division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of August 31 , the same night that the NK I Corps offensive rolled across the river .
Near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th Infantry had crossed to the west side of the Naktong and observed North Korean tank and troop activity 2 miles ( 3 @ . @ 2 km ) west of the river . Information obtained later indicated it was in fact the command post of the NK 9th Division . On August 25 , 9th Infantry commander Colonel John G . Hill outlined projected " Operation Manchu , " which was to be a company @ - @ sized combat patrol to cross the river , advance to the suspected North Korean command post and communications center , destroy it , capture prisoners , and collect intelligence .
The 9th Infantry Regiment had planned Task Force Manchu on orders from the 2nd Division commander Major General Laurence B . Ke ##iser , which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrolling . Ke ##iser decided the patrol should cross the river at the P ##aek ##chin ferry . The 9th Infantry reserve , E Company , reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company , was to be the attack force . The 1st Platoon , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31 . Two heavy weapons companies , D and H , were each to furnish one section of heavy machine guns , one section of 81 @ - @ mm . mortars , and one section of 75 @ - @ mm . rec ##o ##ill ##ess rifles for supporting fires . A platoon of 4 @ . @ 2 @ - @ inch mortars was also to give support .
After dark on August 31 , First Lieutenant Charles I . Caldwell of D Company and First Lieutenant Edward Sch ##mitt of H Company , 9th Infantry , moved their men and weapons to the base of Hill 209 , which was within B Company ' s defense sector and overlooked the P ##aek ##chin ferry crossing of the Naktong River . The raiding force , E Company , was still in its regimental reserve position about 2 miles ( 3 @ . @ 2 km ) west of Y ##ongsan , getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site . Colonel Hill went forward in the evening with the 4 @ . @ 2 @ - @ inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of Hill 209 where the mort ##arm ##en prepared to set up their weapons .
By 21 : 00 , the closest front line unit was B Company on top of Hill 209 , 1 mile ( 1 @ . @ 6 km ) north of the river road which curved around the hill ' s southern base . The regimental chaplain , Captain Lewis B . Sheen , had gone forward in the afternoon to B Company to hold services . On top of Hill 209 , Chap ##lain Sheen and men in B Company after dark heard spl ##ashing in the water below them . They soon discovered a long line of North Korean soldiers w ##ading the river .
The first North Korean crossing at the P ##aek ##chin ferry caught the Heavy Mort ##ar Platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons . It also caught most of the D and H Company men at the base of Hill 209 , . 5 miles ( 0 @ . @ 80 km ) from the crossing site . The North Koreans killed or captured many of the troops there . Hill was there , but escaped to the rear just before midnight , together with several others , when the division canceled Operation Manchu because of the attacks . The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attack engulfed the men below . It hurried on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter . This group was not attacked during the night .
From 21 : 30 until shortly after midnight the NK 9th Division crossed the Naktong at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line positions . Then , when the artillery barrage preparation lifted , the North Korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults . These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward . At each crossing site the North Koreans would overw ##helm local UN defenders before building pontoon bridges for their vehicles and armor .
At 02 : 00 , B Company was attacked . A truck stopped at the bottom of the hill , a whistle sounded , then came a shouted order , and North Korean soldiers started climbing the slope . The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311 , a rugged terrain feature a 1 @ . @ 5 miles ( 2 @ . @ 4 km ) from the river and the North Koreans ' principal immediate objective . The North Koreans apparently were not aware of the Task Force Manchu group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night . But higher up on Hill 209 the North Koreans drove B Company from its position , inflicting very heavy casualties on it . Sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on 4 September .
At 03 : 00 , 1 September , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve , E Company to move west along the Y ##ongsan @ - @ Naktong River road and take a blocking position at the pass between Clover ##leaf Hill and Ob ##ong @ - @ ni Ridge , 3 miles ( 4 @ . @ 8 km ) from the river and 6 miles ( 9 @ . @ 7 km ) from Y ##ongsan . This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the Naktong Bul ##ge . Fighting began at the pass at 02 : 30 when an American medium tank of A Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , knocked out a T @ - @ 34 at T ##ug ##ok , also called Mor ##is ##il . E Company never reached its blocking position . A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03 : 30 from positions ast ##ride the road east of the pass . The company suffered heavy casualties , including the company commander and Ke ##iser ' s aide who had accompanied the force . With the critical parts of Clover ##leaf Hill and Ob ##ong @ - @ ni Ridge , the best defensive terrain between Y ##ongsan and the river , the North Koreans controlled the high ground . The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense of Y ##ongsan on relatively poor defensive terrain , the low hills at the western edge of the town .
= = = US 23rd Infantry attacked = = =
North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the Naktong , the US 23rd Infantry Regiment on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion of the US 38th Infantry Regiment , which in turn had only a few days before relieved the US 21st Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division . On August 1 , the 23rd Regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge . It took over a 16 @ , @ 000 yards ( 15 @ , @ 000 m ) Naktong River front without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north . Colonel Paul L . Freeman , the regimental commander , deployed the 1st Battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast . The 1st Battalion , under US Lieutenant Colonel Claire E . Hutch ##in , Jr . , outpost ##ed the hills with platoons and squads . He placed the 2nd Battalion in a reserve position 8 miles ( 13 km ) behind the 1st Battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector . On August 31 ##h the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector .
Two roads ran through the regimental sector from the Naktong River to Chang ##ny ##ong . The main road bent south along the east bank of the river to Pug ##ong @ - @ ni and then turned northeast to Chang ##ny ##ong . A northern secondary road curved around marsh ##land and lakes , the largest of which was Lake U @ - @ p ' o , to Chang ##ny ##ong . In effect , the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to Chang ##ny ##ong .
The 42 men of the 2nd Platoon , B Company , 23rd Infantry held outpost positions on seven hills covering a 2 @ , @ 600 yards ( 2 @ , @ 400 m ) front along the east bank of the Naktong north of Pug ##ong @ - @ ni . Across the river in the rice padd ##ies they could see , in the afternoon of August 31 , two large groups of North Korean soldiers . Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them . Just before dark , the platoon saw a column of North Koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river . They immediately reported to the battalion command post . The artillery forward observer , who estimated the column at 2 @ , @ 000 people , thought they were refugees . Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column , reducing its number . However the North Koreans continued their advance .
At 21 : 00 the first shells of what proved to be a two @ - @ hour North Korean artillery and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon . As the barrage rolled on , North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire . At 23 : 00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon , forcing it from the hill after a short fight . Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line .
On the regimental left along the main Pug ##ong @ - @ ni @ - @ Chang ##ny ##ong road North Korean soldiers completely overran C Company by 03 ##00 September 1 . Only seven men of C Company could be accounted for , and three days later , after all the str ##ag ##glers and those cut off behind North Korean lines had come in , there were only 20 men in the company . As the North Korean attack developed during the night , 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force , less C Company , just north of Lake U @ - @ p ' o and the hills there covering the northern road into Chang ##ny ##ong , 3 miles ( 4 @ . @ 8 km ) east of the river and 5 miles ( 8 @ . @ 0 km ) west of the town . B Company lost heavily in this action .
When word of the disaster that had overtaken 1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters , Freeman obtained the release of G and F Companies from 2nd Division reserve and sent the former to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road toward Pug ##ong @ - @ ni and C Company . Major Lloyd K . J ##enson , executive officer of the 2nd Battalion , accompanied F Company down the Pug ##ong @ - @ ni road . This force was unable to reach C Company , but J ##enson collected str ##ag ##glers from it and seized high ground ast ##ride this main approach to Chang ##ny ##ong near Pon ##ch ' o @ - @ ri above Lake San ##or ##ho , and went into a defensive position there . The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of the 23 ##d Regiment in front of Chang ##ny ##ong . North Korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion ' s northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions . The 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Service Companies and other misc ##ellaneous regimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post 5 miles ( 8 @ . @ 0 km ) northwest of Chang ##ny ##ong .

Before the morning of 1 September had passed , reports coming in to US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that North Koreans had penetrated to the north @ - @ south Chang ##ny ##ong @ - @ Y ##ongsan road and cut the division in two ; the 38th and 23 ##d Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south . Ke ##iser decided that this situation made it advis ##able to control and direct the divided division as two special forces . Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , Brigadier General Loyal M . Haynes , in command of the northern group . Haynes ' command post was 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of Chang ##ny ##ong . Task Force Haynes became operational at 10 : 20 , September 1 . South ##ward , in the Y ##ongsan area , Ke ##iser placed Brigadier General Joseph S . Bradley , Assistant Division Commander , in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment , the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , most of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and other misc ##ellaneous units of the division . This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley .
All three regiments of the NK 2nd Division @ - @ the 4th , 17th , and 6th , in line from north to south @ - @ crossed during the night to the east side of the Naktong River into the 23rd Regiment sector . The NK 2nd Division , concentrated in the Sin ##ban @ - @ ni area west of the river , had , in effect , attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into Chang ##ny ##ong above and below Lake U @ - @ p ' o . On August 31 , 1950 , Lake U @ - @ p ' o was a large body of water although in most places very shallow .
At dawn September 1 , Ke ##iser at 2nd Division headquarters in Mu ##an @ - @ ni , 7 miles ( 11 km ) east of Y ##ongsan on the Mir ##yang road , felt his division was in the midst of a crisis . The massive North Korean attack had made deep penet ##rations everywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry . The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry ; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry ; and the NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hy ##ong ##p ' ung in the US 38th Infantry sector . At 08 : 10 Ke ##iser teleph ##oned Eighth Army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest North Korean penet ##rations were in the 9th Infantry sector .
Lia ##ison planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the North Korean progress and to locate US 2nd Infantry Division front @ - @ line units . Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken . Beginning at 09 : 30 and continuing throughout the rest of the day , the light aviation section of the division artillery located front @ - @ line units cut off by the North Koreans , and made fourteen air ##drop ##s of ammunition , food , water , and medical supplies . As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a hole 6 miles ( 9 @ . @ 7 km ) wide and 8 miles ( 13 km ) deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe penet ##rations elsewhere . The front @ - @ line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of disorgan ##ization and some companies had virtually disappeared . Ke ##iser hoped he could organize a defense along the Chang ##ny ##ong @ - @ Y ##ongsan road east of the Naktong River , and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading to Mir ##yang and Ch ' on ##g ##do .

At 09 : 00 Walker requested the US Air Force to make a maximum effort along the Naktong River from Tok ##s ##ong @ - @ dong , just above the US 2nd Division boundary , southward and to a depth of 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of the river . He wanted the Air Force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further North Korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the North Korean spear ##head units . The Far East Command requested the US Navy to join in the air effort , and the US Seventh Fleet turned back from its strikes in the Inch ' on @ - @ Seoul area and sped southward at full steam toward the southern battle front . Walker came to the US 2nd Division front at 12 : 00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs . He had already ordered ground reinforcements to the Y ##ongsan area .
During the morning of 1 September , Walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front , wa ##ver ##ing in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves . Since midnight the NK I Corps had broken his Pusan Perimeter in two places @ - @ the NK 2nd and 9th Divisions in the US 2nd Division sector , and the NK 7th Division and NK 6th Division in the US 25th Division sector , below the junction of the Nam and Naktong Rivers . In the US 2nd Division sector North Korean troops were at the edge of Y ##ongsan , the gateway to the corridor leading 12 miles ( 19 km ) eastward to Mir ##yang and the main Pusan @ - @ Muk ##den railroad and highway .
Eighth Army had in reserve three underst ##r ##ength infantry regiments and the 2 @ - @ battalion British 27th Infantry Brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line : The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at Chang ##won , 6 miles ( 9 @ . @ 7 km ) northeast of Masan , preparing for movement to the port of Pusan ; the US 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division which had arrived at Masan only the night before at 20 : 30 to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team , which was then to join the 24th Division in the Taegu area ; and the US 19th Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division , then with that division ' s headquarters at Ky ##ongsan southeast of Taegu . Walker alerted both the 24th Division headquarters , together with its 19th Regiment , and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to move at a moment ' s notice ; the 24th Division either to the 2nd or 25th Division fronts , and the marines to an un ##ann ##ounced destination .
As the morning passed , General Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the Naktong Bul ##ge area of the US 2nd Division sector . There the North Koreans threatened Mir ##yang and with it the entire Eighth Army position . At 11 : 00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward A . Craig , commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the marines to move at once . The marines made ready to depart for the Naktong Bul ##ge at 13 : 30 .
= = = North Korean advance = = =
The situation on the front was chaotic during the day September 1 . The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the K ##ih ##ang ferry , captured Ag ##ok , and scattered A Company , 9th Infantry at its positions from Ag ##ok northward . A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river . From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them , most of them moving east . After several hours , 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to Ag ##ok to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night , returning later with much needed water , rations , and ammunition .
Later in the morning North Korean barges crossed the Naktong below A Company . The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking Ag ##ok to take these troops under fire . When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base . The company hit these houses with artillery . The North Koreans broke from the houses , running for the river . At this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire , as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector . Pro ##x ##imity fu ##ze artillery fire decimated this group . Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force . In the afternoon , US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company ; only part of it was recovered . The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night .
During the withdraw , however , A Company ran into a sizable North Korean force and had scattered in the ensuing fight . Most of the company , including its commander were killed at close range . In this desperate action , Private First Class Luther H . Story , a weapons squad leader , fought so ten ##ac ##iously that he was awarded the Medal of Honor . Bad ##ly wounded , Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape , and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range . Of those in the company , approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines . The next morning , under heavy fog , the group made its way by compass toward Y ##ongsan . From a hill at 12 : 00 , after the fog had lifted , the men looked down on the Battle of Y ##ongsan which was then in progress . That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near Y ##ongsan . Str ##ag ##glers from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well .
= = = The end of Task Force Manchu = = =
In the meantime , Task Force Manchu was still holding its position along the Naktong River , about 5 miles ( 8 @ . @ 0 km ) north of where A Company had been destroyed on the southern end of the line . The perimeter position taken by the men of D and H Companies , 9th Infantry , who had started up the hill before the North Koreans struck , was on a southern kn ##ob of Hill 209 , 0 @ . @ 5 miles ( 0 @ . @ 80 km ) south of B Company ' s higher position . In addition to the D and H Company men , there were a few from the Heavy Mort ##ar Platoon and one or two from B Company . Alt ##ogether , 60 to 70 men were in the group . The group had an SC ##R @ - @ 300 radio , a heavy machine gun , two light machine gun , a M ##19 ##18 Browning Aut ##omatic Rifle , about 20 M1 Gar ##and rifles , and about 40 carb ##ines or pistols . Sch ##mitt assumed command of the group .
During the night Sch ##mitt established radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry . When daylight came Sch ##mitt and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans . One force occupied the higher kn ##ob half a mile above them , formerly held by B Company . Below them , North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some of them already several miles eastward . The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group . They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed . That night an estimated company attacked three times , pressing the fight to close quarters , but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter . Day ##light of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter .
In the afternoon of September 2 Sch ##mitt radio ##ed 1st Battalion for an air ##drop of supplies . A US plane attempted the drop , but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands . The men in the perimeter did , however , recover from a drop made later at 19 : 00 some supplies and ammunition . Private First Class Joseph R . Ou ##ell ##ette , of H Company , left the perimeter to gather weapons , ammunition , and grenades from the North Korean dead . On several occasions he was attacked , and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ou ##ell ##ette , who killed the North Korean in hand @ - @ to @ - @ hand combat .
That same afternoon , the North Koreans sent an American prisoner up the hill to Sch ##mitt with the message , " You have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces . " F ##ailing in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . Only 45 minutes later North Korean antit ##ank fire came in on the kn ##ob and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill 209 swept the perimeter . Soon , mortars empl ##aced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on Sch ##mitt ' s perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his fox ##hole . The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man .
The third day , September 3 , the situation worsened . The weather was hot and ammunition , food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted . Since the previous afternoon , North Korean mortar barr ##ages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter . Surviv ##ors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed . Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . Dead and dying US troops were in almost every fox ##hole . Mort ##ar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units . Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Sch ##mitt never came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times Ou ##ell ##ette le ##aped from his fox ##hole to escape grenades thrown into it . In this close action Ou ##ell ##ette was killed . Most of the fox ##holes of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire . One of these killed Sch ##mitt on September 3 . The command passed now to First Lieutenant Raymond J . McDon ##iel of D Company , senior surviving officer .
At daylight on the morning of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill , were alive . As the day passed , with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight , McDon ##iel decided to abandon the position that night . When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , McDon ##iel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E . Watkins , still alive in his paralyzed condition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . He asked only that his carb ##ine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin . Like O ##ull ##ette , he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions . Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many of them following the Naktong downstream , hiding by day and traveling by night , until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division .
Members of Task Force Manchu who escaped from Hill 209 brought back considerable intelligence information of North Korean activity in the vicinity of the P ##aek ##chin ferry crossing site . At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge . A short distance downstream , each night they placed a pontoon bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning . Car ##rying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night , an estimated total of 800 @ - @ 1 @ , @ 000 carriers being used at this crossing site .

North of the US 9th Infantry and the battles in the Naktong Bul ##ge and around Y ##ongsan , the US 23 ##d Infantry Regiment after daylight of September 1 was in a very precarious position . Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 miles ( 4 @ . @ 8 km ) westward . Approximately 400 North Koreans now overran the regimental command post , compelling Freeman to withdraw it about 600 yards ( 550 m ) . There , 5 miles ( 8 @ . @ 0 km ) northwest of Chang ##ny ##ong , the US 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Headquarters Company , misc ##ellaneous regimental units , and regimental staff officers checked the North Koreans in a 3 @ - @ hour fight .
The North Koreans advanced to Chang ##ny ##ong itself during the afternoon of September 2 , and ROK National Police withdrew from the town . North Koreans were in Chang ##ny ##ong that evening . With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry , Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the Y ##ongsan road in an effort to re @ - @ establish communication . C Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , led its tanks southward . They had to fight their way down the road through several road ##bl ##ocks . Of the three tanks that started , only the lead tank got through to Y ##ongsan . There , it delivered an overl ##ay of Task Force Haynes ' positions to Bradley .
Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active . After the North Korean breakthrough during the night of August 31 , Ke ##iser had ordered the 2nd Battalion , 38th Infantry , to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of Chang ##ny ##ong . In attempting to do this , the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road . They had penetrated to Hill 284 overlooking the 38th Infantry command post . This hill and Hill 209 dominated the rear areas of the regiment . At 06 : 00 September 3 , 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post . The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other . But the Air Force did deliver rocket and straf ##ing strikes .
This fight continued until September 5 . On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 North Koreans . From the crest he and his men watched as many more North Koreans ran into a village below them . Directed artillery fire destroyed the village . Among the abandoned North Korean mater ##iel on the hill , Sch ##auer ' s men found twenty @ - @ five American B ##AR ##s and subm ##ach ##ine guns , a large American radio , thirty boxes of un ##op ##ened American fragmentation and concussion grenades , and some American rations .
= = = 1 @ - @ 23rd Infantry isolated = = =
Meanwhile , during these actions in its rear , the 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , was cut off 3 miles ( 4 @ . @ 8 km ) west of the nearest friendly units . On September 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the Chang ##ny ##ong area . At 14 : 00 a tank @ - @ infantry patrol was sent down the road , but it reported that an estimated North Korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion ' s defense perimeter . Upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to obstruct the movement of North Korean reinforcements and supplies . That evening Freeman approved this request , and 1st Battalion spent three days in the isolated positions . During this time C @ - @ 47 Sky ##tr ##ain planes supplied the battalion by air ##drop ##s .
On the morning of September 1 , 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near Mos ##an @ - @ ni to open the road to the 1st Battalion . On the second day of the fighting at the pass , the relief force broke through the road ##block with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire . The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17 : 00 September 2 . That evening , North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry , on Hill 209 north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion , driving one company from its position .
On September 4 , Haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments , giving the northern part of the 23rd ' s sector to the 38th Infantry , thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to Chang ##ny ##ong . The 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , about 1 @ , @ 100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men . The 23rd Infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on the Pug ##ong @ - @ ni @ - @ Chang ##ny ##ong road . The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion . At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position . In this regimental perimeter , the 23rd Infantry fought a series of hard battles . Simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infilt ##rating North Koreans from Chang ##ny ##ong and from its supply road .
= = = Battle of Y ##ongsan = = =
On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the NK 9th Division , in their first offensive of the war , stood only a few miles short of Y ##ongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line . The 3rd Regiment had been left at Inch ' on , but division commander Major General Pak K ##yo Sam felt the chances of capturing Y ##ongsan were strong .
On the morning of September 1 , with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand , the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Y ##ongsan . Ke ##iser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment . The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Y ##ongsan . The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Y ##ongsan on the northwest .
A Company , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , moved to the south side of the Y ##ongsan @ - @ Naktong River road ; D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road . Approximately 2 miles ( 3 @ . @ 2 km ) west of Y ##ongsan an estimated 300 North Korean troops engaged A Company in a fire fight . M ##19 Gun Motor Car ##riages of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action , which lasted several hours . Meanwhile , with the approval of General Bradley , D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking Y ##ongsan . A platoon of infantry went into position behind it . A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of Y ##ongsan on the left flank of D Company . There , A Company went into position along the road ; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion , and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company . The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town . The road to Mir ##yang came south out of Y ##ongsan , bent around the western tip of this mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base . In its position , D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit , the road to Mir ##yang .
North Koreans had also approached Y ##ongsan from the south . The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in a sharp fight . In this action , Sergeant First Class Charles W . Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself . He mounted a tank , operated its exposed turret machine gun , and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns . Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank ' s per ##isc ##ope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it . Turner , although wounded , remained on the tank until he was killed . That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Y ##ongsan and entered the town from the south .
At 09 : 35 September 2 , while the North Koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of Y ##ongsan and clear the road to Mir ##yang , Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O . Hick ##ey , Deputy Chief of Staff , Far East Command in Tokyo . He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions . He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them . He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward Y ##ongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them , since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command . Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them . Hick ##ey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary . A few hours after this conversation Walker , at 13 : 15 , attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co @ - @ ord ##inated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines , with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line . The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished .
A decision was reached that the marines would attack west at 08 : 00 on September 3 ast ##ride the Y ##ongsan @ - @ Naktong River road ; the 9th Infantry , B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and D Battery of the 82 ##d AAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re @ - @ establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry ; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , remnants of the 1st Battalion , 9th Infantry , and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank , or south , of the marines to reestab ##lish contact with the 25th Division . Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan @ - @ ni area , 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of Mir ##yang and 15 miles ( 24 km ) east of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River . There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone .
The American counter ##offensive of September 3 – 5 west of Y ##ongsan , according to prisoner statements , resulted in one of the blood ##iest deb ##acles of the war for a North Korean division . Even though remnants of the NK 9th Division , supported by the low strength NK 4th Division , still held Ob ##ong @ - @ ni Ridge , Clover ##leaf Hill , and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on September 6 , the division ' s offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack . The NK 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive .
= = = NK 2nd Division destroyed = = =
The NK 2nd Division made a new effort against the 23rd Infantry ' s perimeter in the pred ##awn hours of September 8 , in an attempt to break through eastward . This attack , launched at 02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery , penetrated F Company . It was apparent that unless F Company ' s position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse . When all its officers became casualties , First Lieutenant Ralph R . Robinson , adjutant of the 2nd Battalion , assumed command of the company . With North Koreans rapidly infilt ##rating his company ' s position and gaining its rear , Robinson in the darkness made his way through them 500 yards ( 460 m ) to A Company ' s position . There he obtained that company ' s reserve platoon and brought it back to F Company . He accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of maneuvering it into the gap in F Company ' s lines in darkness and heavy rain .
The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight , but that night it resumed . The North Koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line . This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September . The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops . Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning . All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points . At one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men . When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent .
This heavy night and day battle cost the NK 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength . The medical officer of the NK 17th Regiment , 2nd Division , captured a few days later , said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in Pug ##ong @ - @ ni , and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1 @ , @ 300 killed and 2 @ , @ 500 wounded in the fighting west of Chang ##ny ##ong . Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9 , the division continued to harass rear areas around Chang ##ny ##ong with infilt ##rating groups as large as companies . Patrol ##s daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town .
North Korean and US troops remained locked in combat along the Naktong River for several more days . The North Koreans ' offensive capability was largely destroyed , and the US troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack .
= = = North Korean withdrawal = = =
The UN counterattack at Inch ##on collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes . On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night , and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them . Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea . The North Koreans withdrew from the Masan area first , the night of September 18 – 19 . After the forces there , the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North . The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the Naktong River positions , which were no longer of strategic importance .
= = Aftermath = =
The North Korean 2nd and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles . The 9th Division had numbered 9 @ , @ 350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1 . The 2nd Division numbered 6 @ , @ 000 . Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the fight . The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed , captured or deserted . All of NK II Corps was in a similar state , and the North Korean army , exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inch ##on , was on the brink of defeat .
By this time , the US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1 @ , @ 120 killed , 2 @ , @ 56 ##3 wounded , 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter . This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bul ##ge the previous month . American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter . The division had numbered 17 @ , @ 49 ##8 on September 1 , but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties . The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , most of which probably occurred at Y ##ongsan .
Of all the North Korean attacks along the Pusan Perimeter , the Second Battle of Naktong Bul ##ge is seen by historians as the most serious threat . It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most substantial gains , splitting the US 2nd Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing Y ##ongsan , where they were very close to bre ##aching through to the US forces ' supply lines and threatening other divisions ' rear areas . However , once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points .

Hed PE , also known as ( hed ) Planet Earth and stylized as ( h ##ə ##d ) p . e . , is an American rock band from Huntington Beach , California . Form ##ed in 1994 , the band performs a style of music which it refers to as " G @ - @ punk " , a fusion of punk rock and gang ##sta rap .
After releasing three albums on Jive Records , Hed PE left the label to record independently , eventually signing with Sub ##urban No ##ize Records in 2006 . Since 2006 , the band has become known for its involvement in the 9 / 11 Truth movement , referencing it in many of their song lyrics and concerts , as well as the concept of the album New World Or ##phans . To date , they have released nine studio albums , one live album and two compilation albums .

The band was formed by vocalist Jared G ##omes , formerly of The Cl ##ue , also known as " M . C . U . D . " ( MC Under ##dog ) , and guitarist Wes Ge ##er , who became friends amidst the Orange County hardcore punk scene . G ##omes and Ge ##er recruited guitarist Ch ##iz ##ad , bassist Maw ##k , drummer B . C . V ##aught and DJ Product © 1969 . They named the group " Hed " , which stands for " higher education " . The band built a following with their energetic performances at local venues , and released the self @ - @ financed extended play , Church of Real ##ities . Legal issues forced Hed to change their name , adding " PE " , which stood for " Planet Earth " .
Hed PE signed with Jive Records , releasing their self @ - @ titled debut album in 1997 . In his review of the album , Allmusic ' s Steve Huey wrote " There are some slow and / or unf ##oc ##used moments [ . . . ] but overall , its aggression will probably play well with late - ' 90s metal and punk fans . " Due to the label ' s contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album , the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive . G ##omes is quoted as saying " We had these romantic visions of the music industry , and we thought it would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label . So we fulfilled that dream , but it was also probably the worst thing that could have happened . [ . . . ] We ' ve had offers from Sony and others that we can ' t take because we owe Jive so much money . "

On June 6 , 2000 , Hed PE appeared on the tribute album Nat ##ivity in Black II , covering Black Sabbath ' s " Sabb ##ra Cad ##ab ##ra " . Hed PE released their second studio album , Bro ##ke on August 22 , 2000 . It peaked at No . 63 on the Billboard 200 , while its first single , " Bart ##ender " , peaked at No . 23 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No . 27 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart . Allmusic ' s Jason D .

" The most negative response to the album came from critics who viewed its lyrics as misogyn ##istic .
On October 27 , 2000 , G ##omes was arrested for possession of marijuana while the band was performing in Water ##bury , Connecticut . He was released on a US $ 1 @ , @ 500 bond . In 2001 , Hed PE performed on the Ozz ##fest tour alongside bands such as Korn , St ##atic @ - @ X , and System of a Down .

= Iron ##cl ##ad warship =
An ironclad is a steam @ - @ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century . The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gl ##oire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron @ - @ h ##ulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @ - @ armored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the un ##arm ##ored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War .
Iron ##cl ##ads were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @ - @ range cruisers . The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden @ - @ h ##ulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel @ - @ built , tur ##reted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century . This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns ( the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea ) , more sophisticated steam engines , and advances in metall ##urgy which made steel shipbuilding possible .
The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of flux . Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat . There is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use . New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers .
= = The ironclad = =
The ironclad became technically feasible and tact ##ically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century . According to naval historian J . Richard Hill : " The ( ironclad ) had three chief characteristics : a metal @ - @ skinned hull , steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells . It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad . " Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads .
= = = Steam propulsion = = =
In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate . The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion . While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards , steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s .
Steam @ - @ powered screw frigates were built in the mid @ - @ 1840s , and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle . The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe , which required a challenge to the British at sea . The first purpose @ - @ built steam battleship was the 90 @ - @ gun Nap ##ol ##é ##on in 1850 . Nap ##ol ##é ##on was armed as a conventional ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line , but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , regardless of the wind conditions : a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement .
The introduction of the steam ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line led to a building competition between France and Britain . Eight sister ships to Nap ##ol ##é ##on were built in France over a period of ten years , but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production . Alt ##ogether , France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line , while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41 .
= = = Expl ##os ##ive shells = = =
The era of the wooden steam ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns . In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18 - and 24 @ - @ pounder guns with 32 @ - @ pounders on sailing ships @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line and introducing 68 @ - @ pounders on steamers . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French G ##éné ##ral Henri @ - @ Joseph Pa ##ix ##h ##ans , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sin ##op , spelled the end of the wooden @ - @ h ##ulled warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @ - @ hot shot , which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power .
= = = Iron armor = = =
The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships ' hulls began in the 1830s ; the first " warship " with an iron hull was the gunboat Nemesis , built by Laird for the East India Company in 1839 . There followed , also from Laird , the first full @ - @ blown warships with metal hulls , the 1842 steam frigates Guadel ##upe and Monte ##z ##uma for the Mexican navy . But a thin iron skin , while not being susceptible to fire or lethal splin ##tering like wood , was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire .
Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of Sin ##op , and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the Pa ##ix ##h ##ans guns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War , Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light @ - @ draft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor . Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory , and on 17 July 1854 , the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun @ - @ proof vessels and that plans would be communicated . After tests in September 1854 , the British Admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the French plans , establishing the important Thames and Millwall Iron Works within the docks .
The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War . The role of the battery was to assist un ##arm ##ored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( L ##ave , T ##onn ##ante and Dé ##v ##ast ##ation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kin ##burn on the Black Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences . They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859 . The British floating batteries Gl ##atton and Meteor arrived too late to participate to the action at Kin ##burn . The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the well @ - @ fortified naval base at Kron ##stadt .
The batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only 4 knots ( 7 km / h ) under their own power : they operated under their own power at the Battle of Kin ##burn , but had to be towed for long range transit . They were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy . The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their battle ##fleet .
= = Early ironclad ships and battles = =
By the end of the 1850s it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships , and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required . The result was the first ocean @ - @ going ironclad , the Gl ##oire , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859 .
Gl ##oire ' s wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line , reduced to one deck , she ##athed in iron plates 4 @ . @ 5 inches ( 110 mm ) thick . She was propelled by a steam engine , driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ) . She was armed with thirty @ - @ six 6 @ . @ 4 @ - @ inch ( 160 mm ) rifled guns . France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more sister ships to Gl ##oire , and the only two @ - @ deck ##ed broadside ironclads ever built , Mag ##enta and S ##olf ##ér ##ino .
The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was determined that the first British ironclad would out ##m ##atch the French ships in every respect , particularly speed . A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her inv ##ul ##nerable to enemy fire . The British specification was more a large , powerful frigate than a ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line . The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron . The result was the construction of two Warrior @ - @ class ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince . The ships had a successful design , though there were necessarily comprom ##ises between ' sea @ - @ keeping ' , strategic range and armour protection ; their weapons were more effective than that of Gl ##oire , and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14 @ . @ 3 knots ( 26 @ . @ 5 km / h ) . Yet the Gl ##oire and her sisters had full iron @ - @ armour protection along the waterline and the battery itself . Warrior and Black Prince ( but also the smaller Defence and Resistance ) were obliged to concentrate their armour in a central ' citadel ' or ' armoured box ' , leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected . The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some draw ##backs ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more susceptible to fou ##ling by marine life .
By 1862 , navies across Europe had adopted ironclads . Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction , though the British vessels were larger . Austria , Italy , Russia , and Spain were also building ironclads . However , the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France , and involved ships markedly different from the broadside @ - @ firing , mast ##ed designs of Gl ##oire and Warrior . The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War , and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of L ##issa , had an important influence on the development of ironclad design .
= = = First battles between ironclads : the U . S . Civil War = = =
The first use of ironclads in action came in the U . S . Civil War . The U . S . Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads , its most powerful ships being six steam @ - @ powered un ##arm ##oured frigates . Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union , the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships . In May 1861 , the Confederate Congress voted that $ 2 million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas , and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships .
On 12 October 1861 , the CS ##S Man ##ass ##as became the first ironclad to enter combat , when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the Battle of the Head of Pass ##es . She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting . In February 1862 , the larger CS ##S Virginia joined the Confederate Navy , having been rebuilt at Norfolk . Construct ##ed on the hull of USS Mer ##rim ##ack , Virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood , but she was converted into an iron @ - @ covered casemate ironclad guns ##hip , when she entered the Confederate navy . By this time , the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the City class , and was about to complete the USS Monitor , an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor John Ericsson . The Union was also building a large armored frigate , the USS New Irons ##ides , and the smaller USS Gal ##ena .
The first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862 , as the armored Monitor was deployed to protect the Union ' s wooden fleet from the ironclad ram Virginia and other Confederate warships . In this engagement , the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads , the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor . The battle attracted attention worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date , with the ironclads destroying them easily .
The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides , and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the un ##arm ##ored warships , commerce raiders and blockade runners . The Union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake . The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the Virginia , many of which saw action , but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy — especially in Russia , the only country to openly support the Union through the war . Only CS ##S Stonewall was completed , and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war .
Through the remainder of the war , ironclads saw action in the Union ' s attacks on Confederate ports . Seven Union monitors , including USS Mont ##auk , as well as two other ironclads , the ironclad frigate New Irons ##ides and a light @ - @ draft USS Ke ##ok ##uk , participated in the failed attack on Charleston ; one was sunk . Two small ironclads , CS ##S Palm ##etto State and CS ##S Chic ##ora participated in the defence of the harbor . For the later attack at Mobile Bay , the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the CS ##S Tennessee , the Confederacy ' s most powerful ironclad and the gunboats CS ##S Morgan , CS ##S Gaines , CS ##S Selma .
On the western front , the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads , beginning with several converted river ##boats and then contracting engineer James E ##ads of St . Louis , Missouri to build the City @ - @ class ironclads . These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel , all protected by an armored cas ##ement . They had a shallow draft , allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries , and were very well suited for river operations . E ##ads also produced monitors for use on the rivers , the first two of which differed from the ocean @ - @ going monitors in that they contained a paddle wheel ( the USS Ne ##osh ##o and USS Os ##age ) .
Ar ##gu ##ably E ##ads vessels were some of the better ironclads of the Western Flotilla , but there were a number of other vessels that served val ##iant ##ly with the fleet . All were of varying design , some more successful than others , and some were similar to standard river ##boats but with armored side @ - @ mounted paddle wheels . All were armed with various smooth ##bore and some rifled guns . If nothing else the experience of the American Civil War and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs , some more successful ( or disastrous ) than others , confirmed the emerging trade @ - @ off or comprom ##ises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going on in Europe . There was no such thing as a ' perfect ' ironclad which could be inv ##inc ##ible in every possible encounter ; ship du ##els , standing up to forts , Brown & Blue @ - @ water operations .
The Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts , installations and vessels with relative imp ##un ##ity to enemy fire . They were not as heavily armored as the ocean @ - @ going monitors of the Union , but they were adequate for their intended use . More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes ( mines ) than by enemy fire , and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations , not Confederate vessels .
= = = L ##issa : First fleet battle = = =
The first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , involving ironclad warships was the Battle of L ##issa in 1866 . W ##aged between the Austrian and Italian navies , the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and corv ##ettes and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of Nav ##ar ##ino and Ts ##ushima .
The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships , escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of L ##issa . Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates , four smaller ironclads , and the newly built Aff ##ond ##atore — a double @ - @ turret ##ted ram . Opposing them , the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates .
The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy , so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them . The Austrian fleet formed into an arrow ##head formation with the ironclads in the first line , charging at the Italian ironclad squadron . In the mel ##ée which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns , and by the difficulty of ram ##ming — nonetheless , the effective ram ##ming attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years .
The superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads , Re d ' Italia and Palest ##ro , while the Austrian un ##arm ##oured screw two @ - @ deck ##er SMS Kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads . The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years , and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the Adriatic .
The battles of the American Civil War and at L ##issa were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed . In particular , it taught a generation of naval officers the misleading lesson that ram ##ming was the best way to sink enemy ironclads .
= = Armament and tactics = =
The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless , since their shot would bounce off an armored hull . To penetrate armor , increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships ; nevertheless , the view that ram ##ming was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread . The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside , in the manner of a ship @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ line , towards a handful of guns in turrets for all @ - @ round fire .
= = = Ram c ##ra ##ze = = =
From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare . With steam power freeing ships from the wind , and armor making them inv ##ul ##nerable to shell ##fire , the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow .
The scant damage inflicted by the guns of Monitor and Virginia at Battle of Hampton Roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max sinking the Italian Re d ' Italia at L ##issa gave strength to the ram ##ming c ##ra ##ze . From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram . Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by ram ##ming struggled to be heard .
The revival of ram ##ming had a significant effect on naval tactics . Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle , where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns . This tactic was totally unsu ##ited to ram ##ming , and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray . The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle , and if it had been , combat might have shown that r ##ams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water .
The ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo , with less vulnerability to quick @ - @ firing guns .
= = = Development of naval guns = = =
The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range ; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration . Throughout the ironclad era navies also grap ##pled with the complex ##ities of rifled versus smooth ##bore guns and breech @ - @ loading versus muzzle @ - @ loading .
HMS Warrior carried a mixture of 110 @ - @ pounder 7 inch ( 180 mm ) breech @ - @ loading rifles and more traditional 68 @ - @ pounder smooth ##bore guns . Warrior highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament ; the breech @ - @ load ##ers she carried , designed by Sir William Armstrong , were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy , but were shortly withdrawn from service .
Bre ##ech @ - @ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages . A breech @ - @ load ##er could be rel ##oaded without moving the gun , a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re @ - @ aimed . The Warrior ' s Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smooth ##bore and , because of their rif ##ling , more accurate . Nonetheless , the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech @ - @ load ##ers for decades .
The weakness of the breech @ - @ load ##er was the obvious problem of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas . This explosion prop ##els the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also imp ##oses great stresses on the gun @ - @ barrel . If the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break . This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also end ##anger the gun crew . The Warrior ' s Armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @ . @ 5 in ( 118 mm ) armor of Gl ##oire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing . Similar problems were experienced with the breech @ - @ loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies .
These problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle @ - @ loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s . After a brief introduction of 100 @ - @ pounder or 9 @ . @ 5 @ - @ inch ( 240 mm ) smooth ##bore Somerset Gun , which weighed 6 @ . @ 5 tons ( 6 @ . @ 6 t ) , the Admiralty introduced 7 @ - @ inch ( 178 mm ) rifled guns , weighing 7 tons . These were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons — guns weighing 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre increasing from 8 @ - @ inch ( 203 mm ) to 16 @ - @ inch ( 406 mm ) .
The decision to retain muzzle @ - @ load ##ers until the 1880s has been criticised by historians . However , at least until the late 1870s , the British muzzle @ - @ load ##ers had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech @ - @ load ##ers , which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns .
From 1875 onwards , the balance between breech - and muzzle @ - @ loading changed . Captain de B ##ange invented a method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as compelling ##ly , the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @ - @ loading much more complicated . With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re @ - @ loading , or even re @ - @ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @ - @ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire . In 1882 , the 81 @ - @ ton , 16 @ - @ inch ( 406 mm ) guns of HMS Inf ##lexible fired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding Alexandria during the Ur ##abi Revolt . The 100 @ - @ ton , 450 mm ( 17 @ . @ 72 inch ) guns of Ca ##io Du ##ilio could each fire a round every 15 minutes .
In the Royal Navy , the switch to breech @ - @ load ##ers was finally made in 1879 ; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance , opinion was sway ##ed by an explosion on board HMS Thunder ##er caused by a gun being double @ - @ loaded , a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @ - @ loading gun .
The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on the ship ' s hull , and the less the stability of the ship . The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviest calib ##res of gun ever used at sea . HMS Ben ##bow carried two 16 @ . @ 25 @ - @ inch ( 413 mm ) breech @ - @ loading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as large . The Italian 450 mm ( 17 @ . @ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18 @ . @ 1 @ - @ inch ( 460 mm ) armament of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II . One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slight ##est roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @ - @ platform ' could neg ##ate the advantage of rif ##ling . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smooth ##bore monsters whose round shot could at least ' skip ' along the surface of the water . Act ##ual effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of Sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds . Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem . As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the Iron ##cl ##ad ' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns .
Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . The sharp ##ness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into pell ##ets , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which comb ##usted more slowly again . It also put less stress on the ins ##ides of the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to t ##ighter toler ##ances .
The development of smok ##eless powder , based on nit ##rog ##ly ##cer ##ine or nit ##roc ##ell ##ul ##ose , by the French inventor Paul V ##iel ##le in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels . The guns of the pre @ - @ Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improved prop ##ell ##ants to gain greater muzzle velocity .
The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period . Initially , the best armor @ - @ piercing projectile was a solid cast @ - @ iron shot . Later , shot of ch ##illed iron , a harder iron alloy , gave better armor @ - @ piercing qualities . Eventually the armor @ - @ piercing shell was developed .

= = = = Broad ##side ironclads = = = =
The first British , French and Russian ironclads , in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line , carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called " broadside ironclads . " Both Gl ##oire and HMS Warrior were examples of this type . Because their armor was so heavy , they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck .
A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , principally in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States . The advantages of mounting guns on both broads ##ides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time , and the rigging did not imp ##ede the field of fire .
Broad ##side armament also had disadvant ##ages , which became more serious as ironclad technology developed . He ##avier guns to penetrate ever @ - @ thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried . Furthermore , the adoption of ram ##ming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all @ - @ round fire . These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all @ - @ round fire , which included central @ - @ battery , turret , and barbette designs .
= = = = Tur ##rets , batteries and barbettes = = = =
There were two main design alternatives to the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @ - @ battery ' or ' centre @ - @ battery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or un ##arm ##ored , a barbette .
The centre @ - @ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method . Con ##cent ##rating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and hand ##ier than a broadside type . The first full @ - @ scale centre @ - @ battery ship was HMS Bellerophon of 1865 ; the French laid down centre @ - @ battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870 . Centre @ - @ battery ships often , but not always , had a rec ##essed free ##board enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead .
The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cow ##per Col ##es with a prototype of this installed on HMS Trust ##y in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes . Ericsson ' s turret turned on a central sp ##indle , and Col ##es ' s turned on a ring of bear ##ings . Tur ##rets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging , so they were unsu ##ited to use on the earlier ocean @ - @ going ironclads . The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy . Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low free ##board . The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . Low free ##board , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel . In many respects , the tur ##reted , low @ - @ free ##board Monitor and the broadside sail ##er HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an ' Iron ##cl ##ad ' was all about . The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or ' squ ##aring this circle ' , was designed by Captain Cow ##per Phipps Col ##es : HMS Captain , a dangerously low free ##board turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870 . Her half @ - @ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams . The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was HMS Inf ##lexible of 1876 , which carried two turrets on either side of the centre @ - @ line , allowing both to fire fore , aft and broadside .
A lighter alternative to the turret , particularly popular with the French navy , was the barbette . These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turnt ##able . The crew was sheltered from direct fire , but vulnerable to plung ##ing fire , for instance from shore emplacements . The barbette was lighter than the turret , needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top @ - @ weight of their ships . The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s , and with the addition of an armored ' gun @ - @ house ' , transformed into the turrets of the pre @ - @ Dreadnought battleships .
= = = Torped ##oes = = =
The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped compl ##icate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets . The first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the development of the sp ##ar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative ineff ##iciency of shell ##fire against ironclads , the threat from the sp ##ar torpedo was taken seriously . The U . S . Navy converted four of its monitors to become turret ##less armored sp ##ar @ - @ torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action . Another proposal , the towed or ' Harvey ' torpedo , involved an explosive on a line or out ##rig ##ger ; either to deter a ship from ram ##ming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal .
A more practical and influential weapon was the self @ - @ propelled or Whitehead torpedo . Inv ##ented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s , the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS Inf ##lexible and the Italian Ca ##io Du ##ilio and Enrico Dand ##olo . The ironclad ' s vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the Je ##une Ec ##ole school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo . In practice , however , the Je ##une Ec ##ole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads .
= = Armor and construction = =
The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls , and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden pl ##anking . Iron ##cl ##ads were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s .
= = = Hull ##s : iron , wood and steel = = =
Using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull . However , un ##arm ##ored iron had many military disadvant ##ages , and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years , particularly for long @ - @ range cruising warships .
Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s . In the 1830s and 1840s , France , Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron @ - @ h ##ulled but un ##arm ##ored gunboats and frigates . However , the iron @ - @ h ##ulled frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s , because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot ; iron was more brittle than wood , and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood .
The unsuit ##ability of un ##arm ##ored iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor . However , iron gave the naval architect many advantages . Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design , for instance the use of watertight bulkheads on the lower decks . Warrior , built of iron , was longer and faster than the wooden @ - @ h ##ulled Gl ##oire . Iron could be produced to order and used immediately , in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of season ##ing . And , given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were increasingly cost @ - @ effective . The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough , and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden @ - @ h ##ulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought .
Wooden hulls continued to be used for long @ - @ range and smaller ironclads , because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage . Iron hulls suffered quick fou ##ling by marine life , slowing the ships down — manage ##able for a European battle ##fleet close to dry docks , but a difficulty for long @ - @ range ships . The only solution was to she ##ath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper , a labor ##ious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive . Iron and wood were to some extent interchange ##able : the Japanese Kongō and H ##iei ordered in 1875 were sister @ - @ ships , but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction .
After 1872 , steel started to be introduced as a material for construction . Compared to iron , steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight . The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet , starting with the Red ##out ##able , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 . Red ##out ##able nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate , and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel .
Even though Britain led the world in steel production , the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships . The Bess ##emer process for steel manufacture produced too many imper ##f ##ections for large @ - @ scale use on ships . French manufacturers used the Siemens @ - @ Martin process to produce adequate steel , but British technology l ##agged behind . The first all @ - @ steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury , laid down in 1875 and 1876 .
= = = Armor and protection schemes = = =
Iron @ - @ built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme . HMS Warrior was protected by 4 @ . @ 5 in ( 114 mm ) of wrought iron backed by 15 in ( 381 mm ) of te ##ak , the strongest shipbuilding wood . The wood played two roles , preventing sp ##alling and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship . Later , wood and iron were combined in ' sandwich ' armor , for instance in HMS Inf ##lexible .
Steel was also an obvious material for armor . It was tested in the 1860s , but the steel of the time was too brittle and disintegrated when struck by shells . Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form of compound armor . This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor ( starting with HMS Inf ##lexible ) and then for all armor ( starting with HMS Coloss ##us of 1882 ) . The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately , with licenses being given for the use of the ' Wilson System ' of producing fused armor .
The first ironclads to have all @ - @ steel armor were the Italian Ca ##io Du ##ilio and Enrico Dand ##olo . Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877 . The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet , but found it limited in supply , so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor . Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889 .
The ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel @ - @ steel . In 1890 , the U . S . Navy tested steel armor hardened by the Harvey process and found it superior to compound armor . For several years ' Harvey steel ' was the state of the art , produced in the U . S . , France , Germany , Britain , Austria and Italy . In 1894 , the German firm Krupp developed gas cement ##ing , which further hardened steel armor . The German Kaiser Friedrich III , laid down in 1895 , was the first ship to benefit from the new ' Krupp armor ' and the new armor was quickly adopted ; the Royal Navy using it from HMS Can ##opus , laid down in 1896 . By 1901 almost all new battleships used Krupp armor , though the U . S . continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade .
The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in ( 381 mm ) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in ( 305 mm ) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor , and to 7 @ . @ 75 in ( 197 mm ) of Harvey armor or 5 @ . @ 75 in ( 146 mm ) of Krupp armor .
Iron ##cl ##ad construction also pref ##ig ##ured the later debate in battleship design between tap ##ering and ' all @ - @ or @ - @ nothing ' armour design . Warrior was only semi @ - @ armoured , and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern . As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns , the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished . Inf ##lexible ' s armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships , protecting boilers and engines , turrets and magazines , and little else . An ingen ##ious arrangement of cork @ - @ filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un @ - @ armored sections .
= = Propulsion : steam and sail = =
The first ocean @ - @ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors , and these features were only gradually abandoned . Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry " 5 to 9 days coal " , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads . Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable sc ##rews to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throt ##tle ) , and a telesc ##opic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level .
Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the Crimea , or USS Monitor and her sisters , disp ##ensed with masts from the beginning . The British HMS Dev ##ast ##ation , started in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @ - @ going ironclad to dis ##pense with masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean . The Dev ##ast ##ation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @ - @ range operations in the Adriatic , built consistently mast ##less ironclads .
During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @ - @ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @ - @ expansion engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @ - @ only fleet would require a network of coal ##ing stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as significantly , because of uns ##olved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of double @ - @ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory .
During the 1870s the distinction grew between ' first @ - @ class ironclads ' or ' battleships ' on the one hand , and ' cruising ironclads ' designed for long @ - @ range work on the other . The demands on first @ - @ class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement , which reduced speed under sail ; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconven ##ient . HMS Inf ##lexible , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881 , was the last British battleship to carry masts , and these were widely seen as a mistake . The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships .
S ##ails persisted on ' cruising ironclads ' for much longer . During the 1860s , the French navy had produced the Alma and La Gal ##iss ##onn ##ière classes as small , long @ - @ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like HMS Sw ##ifts ##ure of 1870 . The Russian ship General @ - @ Admiral , laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875 , was a model of a fast , long @ - @ range ironclad which was likely to be able to out ##run and outf ##ight ships like Sw ##ifts ##ure . Even the later HMS Shannon , often described as the first British armored cruiser , would have been too slow to out ##run General @ - @ Admiral . While Shannon was the last British ship with a retractable prop ##ell ##or , later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig , sacrificing speed under steam in consequence . It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long @ - @ range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders , HMS War ##sp ##ite , which was completed in 1888 . While sailing r ##igs were obs ##oles ##cent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s , rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century .
The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple @ - @ expansion steam engine , a further ref ##inement which was first adopted in HMS Sans P ##are ##il , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891 . Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid @ - @ 1900s ( decade ) .

While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide , there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads . Most European nations settled differences on land , and the Royal Navy struggled to maintain a deterr ##ent parity with at least France , while providing suitable protection to Britain ' s commerce and colonial outposts worldwide . Iron ##cl ##ads remained , for the British Royal Navy , a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second . Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th @ - @ century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second @ - @ rate naval powers . But these encounters were often enough to convince British policy @ - @ makers of the increasing hazards of strictly naval foreign intervention , from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the hard ##ening combined defences of naval arsen ##als such as Kron ##stadt and Cherbourg .
There were many types of ironclads :
Se ##ago ##ing ships intended to " stand in the line of battle " ; the precursors of the battleship .
Coastal service and river ##ine vessels , including ' floating batteries ' and ' monitors '
Vess ##els intended for commerce raiding or protection of commerce , called ' armoured cruisers '

The United Kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world for the whole of the ironclad period . The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships , and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles . In the age of sail , the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy . Because of the limited endurance of steam ##ships , this was no longer possible , so the British at times considered the risk @ - @ laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out . To this end , the Royal Navy developed a series of ' coast @ - @ defence battleships ' , starting with the Dev ##ast ##ation class . These ' breast ##work monitors ' were markedly different from the other high @ - @ seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship . As long @ - @ range monitors they could reach Bermuda un ##esc ##orted , for example . However , they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstruct ##ions ( and enemy monitors ) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War . The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kron ##stadt by the close of the Crimean War , but never considered running the smoke @ - @ ridden , shallow @ - @ water g ##aunt ##let straight to St . Petersburg with ironclads . Likewise , monitors proved ac ##utely unable to ' overw ##helm ' enemy fortifications single @ - @ handed during the American conflict , though their low @ - @ profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running g ##aunt ##lets . Mines and obstruct ##ions , however , neg ##ated these advantages — a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period . The British never laid down enough Dev ##ast ##ation @ - @ class ' battleships ' to instantly overw ##helm Cherbourg , Kron ##stadt or even New York City with gunfire . Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals , by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act , which promulgated the idea of a ' two @ - @ power standard ' , that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined . This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s .
British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period . The Royal Navy ' s ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one @ - @ sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 . Def ##ending British interests against Ahmed ' Ur ##abi ' s Egyptian revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria . A mixture of centre @ - @ battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing the Egyptians to retreat ; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five British sailors . Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted , on the other hand , and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact . Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal , they might have quickly turned the tide , for the attacking British ironclads found it easy ( for accuracy ' s sake ) to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets for high @ - @ angle fire upon their thinly armoured top ##d ##ecks .
The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British , but were consistently out @ - @ built by the British . Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech @ - @ loading weapons and steel construction , the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy . In the 1870s , the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the Je ##une Ec ##ole school of naval thought took prominence , suggesting that torpedo boats and un ##arm ##ored cruisers would be the future of warships . Like the British , the French navy saw little action with its ironclads ; the French blockade of Germany in the Franco @ - @ Prussian War was ineffective , as the war was settled entirely on land .
Russia built a number of ironclads , generally copies of British or French designs . Nonetheless , there were real innovations from Russia ; the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser , the General @ - @ Admiral of the 1870s , and a set of remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as ' pop ##ov ##kas ' ( for Admiral Pop ##ov , who conceived the design ) . The Russian Navy pioneered the wide @ - @ scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo @ - @ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 , mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy . Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships , but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership , which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of Ts ##ushima on 27 May 1905 .
The U . S . Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty monitor @ - @ type coastal ironclads ; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve , leaving the USA virtually without an ironclad fleet . Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s . The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas , and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers . The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the Great White Fleet , and it was the modern pre @ - @ Dread ##n ##oughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish – American War of 1898 . This started a new era of naval warfare .
Iron ##cl ##ads were widely used in South America . Both sides used ironclads in the Chin ##cha Islands War between Spain and the combined forces of Peru and Chile in the early 1860s . The powerful Spanish Num ##anc ##ia participated in the Battle of Call ##ao but was unable to inflict significant damage to the Call ##ao defences . Besides , Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War designs , the Loa ( a wooden ship converted into a casemate ironclad ) and the Victoria ( a small monitor armed with a single 68 @ - @ p ##dr gun ) , as well as two British @ - @ built ironclads : Independ ##encia , a centre @ - @ battery ship , and the turret ship Hu ##á ##sc ##ar . Num ##anc ##ia was the first ironclad to circumnav ##igate the world , arriving in C ##ád ##iz on 20 September 1867 , and earning the motto : " En ##lor ##ic ##ata nav ##is que prim ##o ter ##ram circ ##u ##iv ##it " [ " First ironclad ship to sail around the world " ] ) . In the War of the Pacific in 1879 , both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships , including some of those used a few years previously against Spain . While the Independ ##encia ran aground early on , the Peruvian ironclad ' Hu ##á ##sc ##ar made a great impact against Chilean shipping , delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months . She was eventually caught by two more modern Chilean centre @ - @ battery ironclads , the Blanco Enc ##al ##ada and the Almir ##ante Cochrane at the Battle of Ang ##am ##os Point .
Iron ##cl ##ads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy . The Kō ##t ##etsu ( Japanese : 甲 ##鉄 , literally " Iron ##cl ##ad " , later renamed Az ##uma 東 , " East " ) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hak ##od ##ate Bay in May 1869 , which marked the end of the Bosh ##in War , and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration . The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards , first ironclads and later armored cruisers . These ships engaged the Chinese Be ##iy ##ang fleet which was superior on paper at least at the Battle of the Y ##alu River . Thanks to superior short @ - @ range firepower , the Japanese fleet came off better , sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four . The naval war was concluded the next year at the Battle of We ##ih ##ai ##we ##i , where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were surrendered to the Japanese .
= = End of the ironclad warship = =
There is no clearly defined end to the ironclad , besides the transition from wood hulls to all @ - @ metal . Iron ##cl ##ads continued to be used in World War I . Towards the end of the 19th century , the descriptions ' battleship ' and ' armored cruiser ' came to replace the term ' ironclad ' .
The proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships , producing the type known as the pre @ - @ Dreadnought . These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship . The next evolution of battleship design , the dreadnought , is never referred to as an ' ironclad ' .
Most of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the 1900s ( decade ) . For instance , a handful of US navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I . Pre @ - @ Dreadnought battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in World War I and in some cases through to World War II .

The example of the ironclads had some bearing on the history of the tank , as ironclad warships became an inspiration for ideas of land ##ships and other armored vehicles . H . G . Wells , in his short story The Land Iron ##cl ##ads , published in The Strand Magazine in December 1903 , described the use of large , armoured cross @ - @ country vehicles , armed with cannon and machine guns , and equipped with ped ##rail wheels

= Little G ##idding ( poem ) =
Little G ##idding is the fourth and final poem of T . S . Eliot ' s Four Qu ##art ##ets , a series of poems that discuss time , perspective , humanity , and salvation . It was first published in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air @ - @ raids on Great Britain during World War II and Eliot ' s declining health . The title refers to a small Anglican community in Hunting ##d ##onshire , established by Nicholas Ferr ##ar in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War .
The poem uses the combined image of fire and Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and p ##urg ##ation . According to the poet , humanity ' s flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare , but this can be overcome by recognising the lessons of the past . Within the poem , the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures . Little G ##idding focuses on the unity of past , present , and future , and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation .
= = Background = =
Following the completion of the third Four Qu ##art ##ets poem , The Dry Salv ##ages , Eliot ' s health declined and he stayed in Sham ##ley Green , Surrey while he recovered . During this time , Eliot started writing Little G ##idding . The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it . He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write , and that , precipitated by air raids on London , he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly . After the first draft was written , he set the poem aside , and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain .
After months of not working on the poem , Eliot began to feel compelled to finish it ; it was not until August 1942 , however , that he started working on it again . In total , there were five drafts . The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly . Little G ##idding was intended to conclude the Four Qu ##art ##ets series , summar ##ising Eliot ' s views expressed in this series of poems .
Little G ##idding was the home of an Anglican community established in 162 ##6 by Nicholas Ferr ##ar . The Ferr ##ar household lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer . The religious community was dispersed during the English Civil War between Parliament ##arians and Royalists but reformed , ending with the death of John Ferr ##ar in 165 ##7 . Eliot had visited the site in May 1936 .
Unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the Four Qu ##art ##ets poems , Eliot had no direct connection to the original Christian community . As such , the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community .
= = Po ##em = =
Critics classify Little G ##idding as a poem of fire with an emphasis on p ##urg ##ation and the Pentecostal fire . The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter , with attention paid to the arrival of summer . The images of snow , which provoke desires for a spiritual life , transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire , earth , air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four . Following this is a discussion on death and destruction , things unac ##com ##pl ##ished , and regret for past events .
While using Dante ' s ter ##za r ##ima style , the poem continues by describing the Battle of Britain . The image of warfare merges with the depiction of Pentecost , and the Holy Spirit is juxtap ##osed with the air @ - @ raids on London . In the second section , a ghost , representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds , begins talking to the narrator of the poem . The ghost discusses change , art in general , and how hum ##ank ##ind is flawed . The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity , according to the ghost , is to experience p ##urg ##ation through fire . The fire is described in a manner similar to Julian of Norwich ' s writing about God ' s love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Ness ##us , a shirt that burns its wear ##er . Little G ##idding continues by describing the eternal ##ness of the present and how history exists in a pattern . The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn , and that salvation should be the goal of hum ##ank ##ind .
= = Themes = =
In terms of renewal , Eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin . The original Little G ##idding community was built for living on monastic lines , but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646 . The church , the centre of the community , was restored in 1714 and again in 1853 . The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air @ - @ raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world . This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit , Pentecost , communion with the dead , and the repetition of history . The theme is also internal to Eliot ' s own poems ; the image of the rose garden at the end Little G ##idding is the image that begins Bur ##nt Norton and the journey is made circular . Also , the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion .
Like the other poems making up the Four Qu ##art ##ets , Little G ##idding deals with the past , present , and future , and humanity ' s place within them as each generation is seemingly united . In the second section , there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets , including Dante , Swift , Yeats , and others . When the ghost joins the poet , the narrator states " Knowing myself yet being someone other " . This suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge , allowing a communication and connection with the dead . Later , in the fourth section , humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London ; redemption or destruction . God ' s love allows hum ##ank ##ind to be rede ##emed and escape the living hell through p ##urg ##ation by fire . The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet . He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society .
The ghost , a combination of many literary figures , was originally addressed in the poem as " Ser Brun ##etto " before being revised as an ambiguous " you " . " Ser Brun ##etto " was Dante ' s way of addressing Brun ##etto Latin ##i , a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been condemned for sod ##omy . Eliot , in a letter to John Hayward dated 27 August 1942 , explained why he changed the wording :
I think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of Brun ##etto for two reasons . The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that . However , I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to imp ##ute to him the particular vice which took Brun ##etto there . Second ##ly , although the reference to that C ##anto is intended to be explicit , I wish the effect of the whole to be P ##urg ##atorial which is more appropriate . That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of P ##urg ##ator ##io 26 where the poets are found .
The theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of Guido Guin ##iz ##elli , a poet that influenced Dante , seeking such a state in P ##urg ##ator ##io XXV ##I . However , the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing , an act that appears throughout Yeats ' s poetry , within p ##urg ##atorial flames . The critic Dominic Mang ##ani ##ello suggests that , in combining the image of dancing with p ##urg ##ation , Eliot merges Dante ' s and Yeats ' s poetic themes .
= = Reception = =
Critics such as Malcolm Cow ##ley and Del ##more Schwartz describe mixed emotions about the relig ##iosity of the poem . Cow ##ley emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Anglican ##ism while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages . Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little G ##idding . F . B . Pin ##ion believed that the fourth section of the poem costs " Eliot more trouble and v ##ex ##ation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote , and is his greatest achievement in the Four Qu ##art ##ets . " E . M . Forster did not like Eliot ' s emphasis on pain and responded to the poem : " Of course there ' s pain on and off through each individual ' s life . . . You can ' t sh ##irk it and so on . But why should it be endorsed by the school ##master and sanct ##ified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bull ##ies ? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a se ##er . " Writing in 2003 , Roger Scr ##ut ##on wrote that in " Little G ##idding " Eliot achieved " that for which he env ##ies Dante — namely , a poetry of belief , in which belief and words are one , and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language " .

The Portage to San Crist ##ob ##al of A . H . is a 1981 literary and philosophical novella by George Steiner , in which Jewish Nazi hunters find a fictional Adolf Hitler ( A . H . ) alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after the end of World War II . The book generated considerable controversy after its publication because in it , Steiner , who is Jewish , allows Hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by his captors . There Hitler maintains that Israel owes its existence to the Holocaust and that he is the " benefactor of the Jews " .
The Portage to San Crist ##ob ##al of A . H . was a 1983 finalist in the PE ##N / Faulkner Award for Fiction . It was adapted for the theatre by British playwright Christopher Hampton and was staged in London in April 1982 with Alec McC ##ow ##en playing the part of Adolf Hitler . It was also staged in Hartford , Connecticut in the United States in 1983 and starred John Cull ##um as Hitler .
= = Plot summary = =
From his base in Tel Aviv , Holocaust survivor Emmanuel Lieber directs a group of Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler . Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive , and following rumours and hears ##ay , he tracks Hitler ' s movements through South America , until after months of w ##ading through swamps in the Amazon jungle , the search party finds the 90 @ - @ year @ - @ old alive in a clearing . Lieber flies to San Crist ##ó ##bal where he awa ##its the group ' s return with their captive . But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in , and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms .
Meanwhile , broken and inc ##oher ##ent radio messages between Lieber and the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress , and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler ' s capture . Deb ##ates flare up over his impending trial , where it will be held and under whose jurisdiction . O ##ros ##so is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party , and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town . But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber , they must make a decision : do they sit out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later , or do they try Hitler in the jungle before their prize is sn ##atched from them by the world at large , who they know will be waiting ? Their decision is the latter , and against Lieber ' s advice ( " You must not let him speak . . . his tongue is like no other " ) they prepare for a trial with a judge , prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party . Te ##ku , a local Indian track ##er , is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness .
The attention Hitler is receiving , however , renew ##s his strength , and when the trial begins , he br ##ushes aside his " defence attorney " and begins a long speech in four parts in his own defence :
First ##ly , Hitler claims he took his doctrines from the Jews and copied the notion of the master race from the Ch ##osen people and their need to separate themselves from the " uncle ##an " . " My racism is a parody of y ##ours , a hungry imitation . "
Hitler just ##ifies the Final S ##olution by maintaining that the Jews ' God , pur ##er than any other , ensl ##aves its subjects , continually demanding more than they can give and " blackm ##ailing " them with ideals that cannot be attained . The " virus of ut ##opia " had to be stopped .
Hitler states that he was not the origin ##ator of evil . " [ Stalin ] had perf ##ected genocide when I was still a nam ##eless sc ##rib ##b ##ler in Munich . " Further , Hitler asserts that the number of lives lost due to his actions are dwarf ##ed by various world atrocities , including those in Russia , China and Africa .
Lastly , Hitler maintains that the Reich beg ##at Israel and suggests that he is the Messiah " whose infamous deeds were allowed by God in order to bring His people home . " He closes by asking , " Should you not honour me who have made . . . Zion a reality ? "
At the end of his speech , Te ##ku is the first to react and jumps up shouting " Pro ##ven " , only to be drowned out by the appearance of a helicopter over the clearing .

= = Background and publication = =
George Steiner , literary critic for The New Yorker and The New York Times , had written about the Holocaust in some of his previous books , including Ann ##o Domin ##i ( 1964 ) , Language and Silence ( 1967 ) and In Blue ##beard ' s Castle ( 1971 ) . Many of the ideas Steiner expresses in The Portage to San Crist ##ob ##al of A . H . were reworked from these earlier works . Steiner told New York Times editor D . J . R . Bruck ##ner that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language . " Central to everything I am and believe and have written is my aston ##ishment . . . that you can use human speech both to bless , to love , to build , to forgive and also to torture , to hate , to destroy and to annih ##ilate . "
Commenting on the controversy the book generated , Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum ( author of Expl ##aining Hitler ) that he too was disturbed by it , adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him , " gol ##em - or Frankenstein @ - @ like " . He said that it felt like the book " wrote me " . Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust , but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia , Vietnam , El Salvador and Bur ##und ##i : " My feeling is that one has to grap ##ple with the ab ##y ##ss if one can . "
Steiner wrote The Portage to San Crist ##ob ##al of A . H . in 1975 and 1976 in Geneva , Switzerland , and the 120 @ - @ page work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the United States literary magazine , The Kenyon Review . It also appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of Grant ##a , the British literary magazine . Its first publication in book form , with minor revisions by Steiner , was in May 1981 by Faber and Faber in the United Kingdom — and as requested by Steiner , it was a paperback original . The first United States edition was published in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster .

Reaction to The Portage to San Crist ##ob ##al of A . H . was mixed . Anthony Burgess in The Observer called it " astonishing " , Christopher Booker of The Daily Telegraph described it as a " powerful piece " , and English author A . S . By ##att said it was a " masterpiece " . In Expl ##aining Hitler , Ron Rosenbaum called The Portage " A Frankenstein story " , referring to Steiner ' s fict ##ive Hitler has having taken on a life of its own . Writing in Time magazine , Otto Friedrich described the book " a philos ##op ##hic fantasy of remarkable intensity " , adding that by not ref ##uting Hitler ' s speech , Steiner dev ##iates from the hor ##rors of traditional Holocaust literature and ends the book " on a note of bleak ambiguity " .
Morris Dick ##stein of The New York Times was more critical of the book , calling it " a miscon ##ce ##ived and badly executed novel , a sides ##how distraction from the serious business of thinking through the un ##spe ##ak ##able hor ##rors of the Nazi era . " He described it as " wear ##is ##ome " that is " suff ##ocate [ d ] " by too much " fine writing " ( bell ##es @ - @ l ##ett ##res ) . He also complained that the characters are lif ##eless , and while they each have detailed histories , they are only " verbal fig ##ments " that do not separate them from one another . Finally Dick ##stein noted that because almost all the points of Hitler ' s speech are drawn from some of Steiner ' s earlier works , he " unwitting ##ly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pat ##hetic yet also luc ##id and brilliant — at once absurd ##ly harmless and uncon ##v ##inc ##ingly dangerous . "
In another review in The New York Times John Leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points , " some wit , a cath ##olic disdain , multipl ##icity of character and a South American swamp @ - @ life that ter ##rif ##ies " , its weaknesses are that " the characters are really ideas , . . . the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by Kafka and P ##rou ##st " . But Leonard ' s biggest criticism of the book was Hitler ' s speech , which he called " obscene " , and Steiner ' s decision to end the book at that point , which Leonard said " not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend , but . . . makes me sick to my stomach . "
Writing in the American literary magazine Sal ##m ##ag ##und ##i , Alvin H . Rosen ##feld called The Portage a " breakthrough work " that " aston ##ishes " . He was struck by the book ' s inter ##play between the landscape of swamp and jungle , and the " landscape of speech " — the former being " brilliantly registered " with its " immense feeling of physical ##ity " , and the latter , " even more dramatic " in the way it exp ##oses " the dark underside of words " and how its use and mis ##use reveals the true nature of a person . He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as representative of the Jewish consciousness . Rosen ##feld noted that while Holocaust literature often either so ##ars to " exp ##ost ##ulation and apost ##rop ##he " , or sin ##ks to " a dwindling sob of eleg ##iac lament " , Steiner ' s Lieber " med ##iates between these two extremes , . . . simultaneously records and mourn ##s , cold ##ly enumer ##ates yet carries an immense affect " . What did concern the reviewer , however , was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works , that he had put them " virtually verb ##at ##im " into Hitler ' s mouth , creating the impression that " Steiner ' s understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter ' s self @ - @ understanding " . Rosen ##feld also questioned why the book had to end with Hitler ' s speech . He said that Steiner ' s fict ##ive Hitler plays " the devil ' s game of language subvers ##ion " , making " madness [ sound ] like music " , something the real Hitler had perf ##ected . By stopping at this point , Rosen ##feld felt that Steiner " succumb [ s ] , rhet ##or ##ically , to the seductive eloqu ##ence of neg ##ation " , which underm ##ines his own " high standards of moral intelligence " . But overall Rosen ##feld said The Portage " must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of Hitler " , forcing us to confront him " in a way hardly seen before in fiction " .
The Portage to San Crist ##ob ##al of A . H . was a finalist in the 1983 PE ##N / Faulkner Award for Fiction .
= = Controversy = =
The book generated considerable controversy because of its apparent " admiration for Hitler " . The controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation ( " too faithful " , according to Steiner ) was performed in the United Kingdom and the United States .
Hitler ' s speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics . Steiner not only lets Hitler justify his past , he allows him the ( almost ) last word before the outside world inv ##ades . The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious . One critic , while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitler as " the incarnation of unprecedented and unpar ##all ##eled evil " , felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between Steiner ' s own views and those of his fictional Hitler , even going so far as to accuse Steiner , who rejects Jewish nationalism and is a critic of Israel ' s treatment of the Palestinians , of anti @ - @ Sem ##itism .
In contrast , a Time magazine article at the time felt that Steiner ' s intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief " that Hitler wield ##ed language as an almost supernatural force " , drawing attention to Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber ' s warning from the book regarding Hitler : " There shall come a man who . . . will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others . He will know the sounds of madness and lo ##athing and make them seem music . "
Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler ' s speech in this book is un ##chall ##enged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan ' s speech in Milton ' s Paradise Lost ( 166 ##7 ) , and The Grand In ##quis ##itor ' s speech in Dost ##oy ##evsky ' s The Brothers Kar ##am ##az ##ov ( 1880 ) . He also reminded the reader that Hitler ' s speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber ' s long monologue on the hor ##rors of the Holocaust . Finally , Steiner said that his Hitler ( A . H . ) is " a fict ##ive figure " , and that it is not he who has the last word , but Te ##ku , the Indian track ##er , who shouts " Pro ##ven " . Te ##ku is also the Hebrew word used to indicate that " there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide . "

Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i ( from Greek τ ##έ ##μ ##ν ##ε ##ι ##ν ( tem ##ne ##in , " to cut " ) and σ ##π ##ό ##ν ##δ ##υ ##λ ##ος ( sp ##ond ##yl ##os , " verteb ##ra " ) ) is a diverse sub ##class of extinct small to giant tet ##rap ##ods — often considered primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the Carbon ##iferous , Perm ##ian , and Triassic periods . A few species continued into the Cretaceous . Foss ##ils have been found on every continent . During about 210 million years of evolutionary history , they adapted to a wide range of habitats , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . Their life history is well understood , with fossils known from the larval stage , metamorphosis , and maturity . Most tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were sem ##ia ##qu ##atic , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . These tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . Although tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armour @ - @ like bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians .
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles . They were described at various times as bat ##rach ##ians , st ##ego ##cephal ##ians , and lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts , although these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped in Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i were spread out among several amphib ##ian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae . Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i means " cut vertebrae " , as each verteb ##ra is divided into several parts .
Exper ##ts disagree over whether tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were ancestral to modern amphibians ( frogs , salamanders , and ca ##ec ##ilians ) , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants . Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , another group of early tet ##rap ##ods called le ##p ##ospond ##yls , or even as descendants of both groups ( with ca ##ec ##ilians evolving from le ##p ##ospond ##yls and frogs and salamanders evolving from tem ##n ##ospond ##yls ) . Recent studies place a family of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls called the amphib ##am ##ids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians . Similar ##ities in teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link the two groups .
= = Description = =
Many tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are much larger than living amphibians , and super ##fic ##ially resemble crocodiles . Others are smaller and resemble salamanders . Most have broad , flat heads that are either blunt ( brev ##iro ##st ##rine ) or elongated ( long ##iro ##st ##rine ) . The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above , and are usually covered in pits and ridges . The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels , which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutral ##ize acidic build up in the blood ( early sem ##ia ##qu ##atic tet ##rap ##ods would have had difficulty exp ##elling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land , and these derm ##al bones may have been an early solution to the problem ) . Many tem ##n ##ospond ##yls also have canal @ - @ like grooves in their skulls called sensory sul ##ci . The sul ##ci , which usually run around the nostrils and eye s ##ockets , are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water . As sem ##ia ##qu ##atic animals , most tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot . Ter ##restrial tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have larger , thicker limbs , and some even have claws . One unusual terrestrial tem ##n ##ospond ##yl , Fay ##ella , has relatively long limbs for its body , and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey .
Hom ##olog ##ues of most of the bones of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are also seen in other early tet ##rap ##ods , aside from a few bones in the skull , such as inter ##front ##als , intern ##as ##als , and inter ##par ##iet ##als , that have developed in some tem ##n ##ospond ##yl taxa . Most tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have tab ##ular horns in the backs of their skulls , rounded projections of bone separated from the rest of the skull by ind ##ent ##ations called o ##tic not ##ches ; in some tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , such as Z ##at ##rach ##ys , they are pointed and very prominent . Among the most distinguishing features of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are the interp ##tery ##go ##id vac ##u ##ities , two large holes in the back of the palate . Another pair of holes , cho ##an ##ae , are present in front of these vac ##u ##ities , and connect the nasal passage with the mouth . Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls often have teeth on their pal ##ates , as well as in their jaws . Some of these teeth are so large , they are referred to as tusks . In some tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , such as Niger ##p ##eton , tusks in the lower jaw pier ##ce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull .
Very little is known of the soft tissue of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls . A block of sandstone , described in 2007 from the Early Carbon ##iferous Mau ##ch Ch ##unk Formation of Pennsylvania , included impressions of the bodies of three tem ##n ##ospond ##yls . These impressions show , when alive , they had smooth skin , robust limbs with web ##bed feet , and a ridge of skin on their unders ##ides . Track ##ways refer ##able to small tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have also been found in Carbon ##iferous and Perm ##ian rocks . The track ##ways , called bat ##rach ##ich ##ni , are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments , suggesting the animals had some ties to the water .
Unlike modern amphibians , many tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are covered in small , closely packed scales . The unders ##ides of most tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are covered in rows of large ventral plates . During early stages of development , they first have only small , rounded scales . Foss ##ils show , as the animals grew , the scales on the unders ##ides of their bodies developed into large , wide ventral plates . The plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility . Later sem ##ia ##qu ##atic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , such as tre ##mat ##osaurs and capit ##osaurs , have no evidence of scales . They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cut ##aneous respiration , the absorption of oxygen through the skin .
Several groups of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have large bony plates on their backs . One tem ##n ##ospond ##yl , P ##elt ##ob ##at ##r ##achus , has armour @ - @ like plating that covers both its back and underside . The tem ##n ##ospond ##yl L ##aid ##ler ##ia also has extensive plating on its back . Most members of the family Diss ##or ##oph ##idae also have armor , although it only covers the mid ##line of the back with two narrow rows of plates . Other tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , such as E ##ry ##ops , have been found with small , disc @ - @ like bony sc ##utes that were in life probably embedded in the skin . All of these tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle . Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of P ##elt ##ob ##at ##r ##achus . The sc ##utes may have provided stability for the spine , as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong lig ##aments . Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls such as Sc ##ler ##othorax and E ##ry ##ops that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine . B ##ony sc ##utes are also seen in plag ##iosa ##urs , but unlike P ##elt ##ob ##at ##r ##achus , L ##aid ##ler ##ia , E ##ry ##ops , and diss ##or ##oph ##ids , these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic . Pl ##ag ##iosa ##urs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor , as both P ##elt ##ob ##at ##r ##achus and L ##aid ##ler ##ia have been considered close relatives of the group .
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living tet ##rap ##ods , the main body of the verteb ##ra is a single piece of bone called the cent ##rum , but in tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , this region was divided into a ple ##uro ##cent ##rum and inter ##cent ##rum . Two types of vertebrae are recognized in tem ##n ##ospond ##yls : stere ##ospond ##yl ##ous and rh ##ach ##it ##om ##ous vertebrae . In rh ##ach ##it ##om ##ous vertebrae , the inter ##cent ##ra are large and wedge @ - @ shaped , and the ple ##uro ##cent ##ra are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine @ - @ like neural arch , and well @ - @ developed interl ##ocking projections called z ##yg ##ap ##ophys ##es strengthen the connections between vertebrae . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many r ##atch ##it ##om ##ous tem ##n ##ospond ##yls allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial . In stere ##ospond ##yl ##ous vertebrae , the ple ##uro ##cent ##ra have been lost entirely , with the inter ##cent ##ra enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the stere ##ospond ##yl ##ous tem ##n ##ospond ##yls spent more time in water .
= = History of study = =
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i was named by German palae ##ont ##ologist Karl Alfred von Z ##itt ##el in his second edition of Hand ##b ##uch der Palae ##ont ##olog ##ie , published in 1888 . Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl remains were known since the early part of the 19th century , however . The earliest described tem ##n ##ospond ##yl was Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus , named by Georg Friedrich Ja ##eger in 1828 . Ja ##eger named Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus from a single tooth , and considered it a reptile . Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus means " breast tooth lizard " after the n ##ipple @ - @ like shape of the tip of the tooth .
The naming of these first specimens was disputed , however . Leopold Fitz ##inger named the animal Bat ##rach ##osaurus in 1837 . In 1841 , English palae ##ont ##ologist Richard Owen referred to the genus as Labyrinth ##odon to describe its highly folded or lab ##yrinth ##ine teeth . Owen thought the name Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus " ought not to be retained , because it recalls unav ##oid ##ably the idea of the mammalian genus Mast ##odon , or else a mamm ##ill ##oid form of the tooth . . . and because the second element of the word , s ##aurus , indicates a false affinity , the remains belonging , not to the Saur ##ian , but to the Bat ##rach ##ian order of Rept ##iles . " Owen recognized the animal was not a " s ##aur ##ian " reptile , yet he also referred Ja ##eger ' s P ##hy ##t ##osaurus to the genus . Although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth , P ##hy ##t ##osaurus was later found to be a crocodile @ - @ like reptile . Additional material , including skulls , firmly placed Labyrinth ##odon as an amphib ##ian . Ja ##eger also named Salam ##andro ##ides gig ##ante ##us in 1828 , basing it on partial occ ##ip ##ut , or back portion of the skull . In 1833 , he described a complete skull of S . gig ##ante ##us that had the same teeth as his Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus , making it the first known complete skull of a tem ##n ##ospond ##yl . Because Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus was named first , it has precedence over the other names as a senior subjective synonym . Bat ##rach ##osaurus is still used as the name of an unrelated brachy ##op ##id tem ##n ##ospond ##yl .
Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus and other similar animals were referred to as lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts , named like Labyrinth ##odon for teeth that were highly folded in cross section . Owen ' s " Labyrinth ##odon Ja ##eg ##eri " was later found at Guy ' s Cliff ##e , England by paleontologist William Buck ##land . Other specimens were found in the red sandstone of Warwickshire . As more fossils were uncovered in England , Owen depicted these lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts as the " highest " form of bat ##rach ##ian and compared them to crocodiles , which he considered the highest form of reptiles . He also noted the large lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts of the Ke ##uper ( a unit of rocks that dates to the Late Triassic ) were younger than more advanced reptiles in the Mag ##nes ##ian and Z ##ech ##stein , which are Late Perm ##ian in age . Owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a sequ ##ential progression from early amphibians ( what he called " metamorph ##osed fishes " ) .
In addition to Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus , some of the earliest named genera included Met ##op ##ias and Rh ##omb ##oph ##olis in 1842 , Z ##yg ##osaurus in 1848 , Trem ##at ##osaurus in 1849 , B ##ap ##het ##es and D ##end ##r ##er ##p ##eton in 1853 , Cap ##it ##osaurus in 1858 , and D ##asy ##ce ##ps in 1859 . B ##ap ##het ##es is now placed as an early tet ##rap ##od outside Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i , and Rh ##omb ##oph ##olis is now considered a prol ##ac ##ert ##iform reptile .
Later in the 19th century , tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were classified as various members of St ##ego ##ceph ##alia , a name coined by American paleontologist Edward Dr ##inker Cope in 1868 . Cope placed st ##ego ##cephal ##ians in the class Bat ##rach ##ia , the name then used for Amph ##ibia . St ##ego ##ceph ##alia means " roof @ - @ headed " in Greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls and other early tet ##rap ##ods . During this time , palae ##ont ##ologists considered tem ##n ##ospond ##yls to be amphibians because they possessed three main features : gill arches in juvenile skeletons , indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ; ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage ; and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for muc ##ous glands .
Several sub ##orders of st ##ego ##cephal ##ians were recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Animals now regarded as tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were primarily lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts , but some were classified in the Branch ##ios ##aur ##ia . Branch ##iosa ##urs were small @ - @ bodied and had simple conical teeth , while lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts were larger and had complex , folded dent ##in and enamel in their teeth . Branch ##ios ##aur ##ia included only a few forms , such as Branch ##ios ##aurus from Europe and Amphib ##amus from North America , that had poorly developed bones , external gills , and no ribs . Some skeletons of Amphib ##amus were later found with long ribs , prompting its reass ##ignment to Mic ##rosaur ##ia ( although more detailed studies found it to be a tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ) . Soft tissue , such as scales and external gills , were found in many well @ - @ preserved branch ##ios ##aur fossils from Germany . In the early 20th century , branch ##iosa ##urs would be recognized as larval forms of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls lacking many of the typical features that define the group , and is no longer recognized as a distinct group .
Other animals that would later be classified as tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were placed in a group called G ##ano ##ceph ##ala , characterized by plate @ - @ like skull bones , small limbs , fish @ - @ like scales , and branch ##ial arches . Unlike lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts , they did not have par ##ietal for ##am ##ena , small holes in their skulls behind their eye s ##ockets . Ar ##che ##g ##osaurus , D ##end ##r ##er ##p ##eton , E ##ry ##ops and Tr ##imer ##or ##h ##ach ##is were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of Rept ##ilia . Their rh ##ach ##it ##om ##ous vertebrae , not ##och ##ord , and lack of occ ##ip ##ital cond ##yles ( which attached the head to the neck ) were features that were also shared with fishes . Thus , they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as st ##ego ##cephal ##ians .
Another group called Mic ##rosaur ##ia was named by Cope in 1868 . Cope classified Mic ##rosaur ##ia as a subgroup of Labyrinth ##odont ##ia , placing many small , amphib ##ian @ - @ like animals within it . Among them were D ##end ##r ##er ##p ##eton , once placed in G ##ano ##ceph ##ala . D ##end ##r ##er ##p ##eton was later placed as a lab ##yrinth ##odont with other tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians .
By the end of the 19th century , most of what are today regarded as tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were placed in the sub ##order Labyrinth ##odont ##a . American paleontologist Er ##m ##ine Cow ##les Case called it Labyrinth ##odont ##a ver ##a or " true lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts " . The names St ##ego ##ceph ##alia and Labyrinth ##odont ##ia were used interchange ##ably to refer to the order in which it belonged . The lab ##yrinth ##odont ##ian sub ##orders Mic ##rosaur ##ia and Branch ##ios ##aur ##ia , both of which contain tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , were distinct from Labyrinth ##odont ##a . Within Labyrinth ##odont ##a were the groups Rh ##ach ##it ##omi , Labyrinth ##odont ##i , and Emb ##oler ##imi . Members of Rh ##ach ##it ##omi , such as Ar ##che ##g ##osaurus and E ##ry ##ops , had rh ##ach ##it ##om ##ous vertebrae with enlarged inter ##cent ##ra that displaced the ple ##uro ##cent ##ra . Labyrinth ##odont ##i , such as Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus , Trem ##at ##osaurus , and Mic ##rop ##hol ##is , had lost their ple ##uro ##cent ##ra , and the inter ##cent ##ra made up the entire body of the vertebrae . Emb ##oler ##imi had inter ##cent ##ra and ple ##uro ##cent ##ra that were of equal size . Emb ##ol ##omer ##es are now identified as rept ##ili ##omorph ##s dist ##antly related to tem ##n ##ospond ##yls .
In 1888 , von Z ##itt ##el divided st ##ego ##cephal ##ians among three taxa : Lep ##ospond ##yl ##i , Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i , and Stere ##ospond ##yl ##i . He placed mic ##rosa ##urs in Lep ##ospond ##yl ##i , a group which he characterized as having simple , sp ##ool @ - @ shaped verteb ##ral cent ##ra . Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i included forms with the cent ##ra divided into ple ##uro ##cent ##ra and inter ##cent ##ra . All members of Stere ##ospond ##yl ##i had amph ##ico ##el ##ous cent ##ra composed only of the inter ##cent ##ra . Cope objected to von Z ##itt ##el ' s classification , considering the vertebrae of le ##p ##ospond ##yls and stere ##ospond ##yls indistinguishable because each had a simple sp ##ool shape . He continued to use G ##ano ##ceph ##ala and Labyrinth ##odont ##a ( which he alternatively referred to as Rh ##ach ##it ##omi ) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occ ##ip ##ital cond ##yles .
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i became a commonly used name at the turn of the century . Pale ##ont ##ologists included both emb ##ol ##omer ##es and rh ##ach ##it ##omes in the group . Cope ' s G ##ano ##ceph ##ala and Labyrinth ##odont ##a fell out of use . In 1919 , British paleontologist D . M . S . Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae . Emb ##ol ##om ##erous forms in the Carbon ##iferous graded into rh ##ach ##it ##om ##ous forms in the Perm ##ian , and finally into stere ##ospond ##yls in the Triassic . More importantly , Watson began using the term Labyrinth ##odont ##ia to refer to these groups . The name Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i was rarely used in the decades that followed . Swedish paleontologist Gun ##nar S ##ä ##ve @ - @ Sö ##der ##bergh removed emb ##ol ##omer ##es from the group , narrowing its scope to rh ##ach ##it ##omes and stere ##ospond ##yls . His classification of lab ##yrinth ##odon ##ts was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae .
American paleontologist Alfred Romer brought the name Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i back into use in the later 20th century . S ##ä ##ve @ - @ Sö ##der ##bergh used the name Labyrinth ##odont ##ia in a strict sense ( sens ##u strict ##o ) to refer to Rh ##ach ##it ##omi and Stere ##ospond ##yl ##i , excluding Emb ##ol ##omer ##i . Romer agreed with this classification , but used the name Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i to avoid confusion with Labyrinth ##odont ##ia in its wider sense ( sens ##u l ##ato ) . Unlike modern tem ##n ##ospond ##yl classification , however , Romer included the primitive Ich ##thy ##ost ##eg ##alia in the group .
= = Evolution ##ary history = =
= = = Carbon ##iferous and Early Perm ##ian = = =
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls first appeared in the Early Carbon ##iferous around 330 million years ago ( Mya ) . During the Carbon ##iferous , tem ##n ##ospond ##yls included basal medium @ - @ sized forms such as D ##end ##r ##er ##p ##eton or large sem ##ia ##qu ##atic forms such as Coch ##le ##osaurus . Other , more derived tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , such as the amphib ##am ##ids , were smaller and more terrestrial . They resembled salamanders , and some taxa , such as the genus Branch ##ios ##aurus , even retained external gills like the modern @ - @ day ax ##ol ##ot ##l . During the latest Carbon ##iferous and Early Perm ##ian around 300 Mya , several groups , such as the diss ##or ##oph ##ids and tre ##mat ##op ##ids evolved strong , robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the e ##ry ##op ##ids , developed into large sem ##ia ##qu ##atic predators . The d ##vin ##osaurs , a group of small aquatic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the Late Carbon ##iferous .
= = = Late Perm ##ian = = =
During the Late Perm ##ian , increasing ar ##idity and the divers ##ification of reptiles contributed into a decline in terrestrial tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , but sem ##ia ##qu ##atic and fully aquatic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls continued to flourish , including the large Mel ##osaurus of Eastern Europe . Other tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , such as arche ##g ##osaurids , developed long sn ##outs and a close similarity to crocodiles , although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group . These tem ##n ##ospond ##yls included the largest known amphib ##ian , the 9 @ - @ m @ - @ long Pr ##ion ##os ##uchus of Brazil .
= = = Mes ##ozoic = = =
As tem ##n ##ospond ##yls continued to flourish and divers ##ify in the Late Perm ##ian ( 260 @ . @ 4 - 251 @ . @ 0 Mya ) , a major group called Stere ##ospond ##yl ##i became more dependent on life in the water . The vertebrae became weak , the limbs small , and the skull large and flat , with the eyes facing upwards . During the Triassic period , these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems , evolving in a range of both small and large forms . During the Early Triassic ( 251 @ . @ 0 - 245 @ . @ 0 Mya ) one group of successful long @ - @ sn ##outed fish @ - @ eat ##ers , the tre ##mat ##osau ##ro ##ids , even adapted to a life in the sea , the only known amphibians to do so with the exception of the modern crab @ - @ eating frog . Another group , the capit ##osau ##ro ##ids , included medium - and large @ - @ sized animals 2 @ . @ 3 to 4 m ( 7 @ . @ 5 to 13 @ . @ 1 ft ) in length , with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the largest forms such as Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus . These animals spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic predators , catching their prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and sucking in fish or other small animals .
In the Carn ##ian stage of the Late Triassic ( 228 @ . @ 0 - 216 @ . @ 5 Mya ) , capit ##osau ##ro ##ids were joined by the super ##fic ##ially very similar Met ##op ##osauridae . Met ##op ##osaurids are distinguished from capit ##osau ##ro ##ids by the positioning of their eye s ##ockets near the front of their skulls . Another group of stere ##ospond ##yls , the plag ##iosa ##urs , had wide heads with external gills , and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers . By this time , tem ##n ##ospond ##yls had become a common and widespread component of sem ##ia ##qu ##atic ecosystems . Some tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , such as Cry ##ob ##at ##r ##achus and Kry ##ost ##ega , even inhabited Antarctica , which was covered in temperate forests at the time .
Triassic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were often the dominant sem ##ia ##qu ##atic animals in their environments . Large assemb ##l ##ages of met ##op ##osaurs with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern United States . They have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by d ##rough ##ts in flood ##plain environments . Recent studies show these dense assemb ##l ##ages were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas . These environments seem to have had little diversity , as they were inhabited almost exclusively by met ##op ##osaurs .
The Triassic @ - @ Jurassic extinction event around 199 @ . @ 6 Mya led to the extinction of most Mes ##ozoic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls . The brachy ##op ##oids survived , as well as a few capit ##osau ##ro ##ids and tre ##mat ##osau ##ro ##ids . While the latter two groups soon became extinct , brachy ##op ##oids persisted and grew to large sizes during the Jurassic . Among brachy ##op ##oids , the brachy ##op ##ids flourished in China and the ch ##ig ##ut ##is ##aur ##ids became common in Gond ##wana . The most recent known tem ##n ##ospond ##yl was the giant ch ##ig ##ut ##is ##aur ##id K ##ool ##as ##uchus , known from the Early Cretaceous of Australia . It survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the winter for crocodiles that normally would have competed with them . K ##ool ##as ##uchus was one of the largest of the brachy ##op ##oids , with an estimated weight of 500 kg ( 1 @ , @ 100 lb ) .
= = Classification = =
Originally , tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the sub ##order Rach ##it ##omi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the sub ##order Stere ##ospond ##yl ##i . With the recent growth of phylogen ##etics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rh ##ach ##it ##om ##ous condition is found in many primitive tet ##rap ##ods , and is not unique to one group of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls . Moreover , the distinction between rh ##ach ##it ##om ##ous and stere ##ospond ##yl ##ous vertebrae is not entirely clear . Some tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have rh ##ach ##it ##om ##ous , sem ##ir ##h ##ach ##it ##om ##ous , and ster ##ospond ##yl ##ous vertebrae at different points in the same verteb ##ral column . Other taxa have intermediate morph ##ologies that do not fit into any category . Rach ##it ##omi is no longer recognized as a group , but Stere ##ospond ##yl ##i is still considered valid .

In one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses of the group , Gardiner ( 1983 ) recognized five characteristics that made Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i a clade : a bone at the back of the skull , the paras ##p ##hen ##oid , is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull , the p ##tery ##go ##id ; large openings called interp ##tery ##go ##id vac ##u ##ities are present between the p ##tery ##go ##ids ; the st ##apes ( a bone involved in hearing ) is connected to the paras ##p ##hen ##oid and projects upward ; the cle ##ith ##rum , a bone in the pectoral gird ##le , is thin ; and part of the verteb ##ra called the interd ##ors ##al att ##aches to the neural arch . Additional features were given by Godfrey et al . ( 1987 ) , including the contact between the post ##par ##ietal and ex ##occ ##ip ##ital at the back of the skull , small projections ( unc ##inate processes ) on the ribs , and a pelvic gird ##le with each side having a single il ##iac blade . These shared characteristics are called syn ##ap ##omorph ##ies .
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are placed as basal tet ##rap ##ods in phylogenetic analyses , with their exact positioning varying between studies . Depending on the classification of modern amphibians , they are either included in the crown group Tet ##rap ##oda or the stem of Tet ##rap ##oda . Crown @ - @ group tet ##rap ##ods are descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all living tet ##rap ##ods and stem tet ##rap ##ods are forms that are outside the crown group . Modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , which would place them within crown Tet ##rap ##oda . Below is a clad ##ogram from Rut ##a et al . ( 2003 ) placing Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i within crown Tet ##rap ##oda :
Other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants of le ##p ##ospond ##yls and place tem ##n ##ospond ##yls in a more basal position within the stem of Tet ##rap ##oda . Below is a clad ##ogram from Laur ##in and Re ##is ##z ( 1999 ) placing Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i outside crown Tet ##rap ##oda :
Most phylogenetic analyses of tem ##n ##ospond ##yl inter ##rel ##ations ##hips focus on individual families . One of the first broad @ - @ scale studies of tem ##n ##ospond ##yl phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist Andrew Milner in 1990 . A 2007 study made a " super ##tree " of all tem ##n ##ospond ##yl families , combining the family @ - @ level trees of previous studies . The following clad ##ogram is modified from Rut ##a et al . ( 2007 ) :
1 Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ##i , 2 Ed ##op ##o ##idea , 3 D ##vin ##osaur ##ia , 4 E ##usk ##elia , 5 E ##ry ##op ##o ##idea , 6 Diss ##or ##oph ##o ##idea , 7 Lim ##n ##arch ##ia , 8 Ar ##che ##g ##osau ##ro ##idea , 9 Stere ##ospond ##yl ##i , 10 Rhy ##t ##id ##ost ##ea , 11 Br ##achy ##op ##o ##idea , 12 Cap ##it ##osaur ##ia , 13 Trem ##at ##osaur ##ia , 14 Met ##op ##osau ##ro ##idea
The most basal group of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls is the super ##family Ed ##op ##o ##idea . Ed ##op ##oids have several primitive or pl ##esi ##omorphic features , including a single occ ##ip ##ital cond ##yle and a bone called the intert ##em ##por ##al that is absent in other tem ##n ##ospond ##yls . Ed ##op ##oids include the Late Carbon ##iferous genus Ed ##ops and the family Coch ##le ##osauridae . D ##end ##r ##er ##pet ##ont ##idae has also been included in Ed ##op ##o ##idea , and is the oldest known tem ##n ##ospond ##yl family . Bal ##an ##er ##p ##eton wood ##i is the oldest species , having been present over 330 million years ago during the Vis ##é ##an stage of the Early Carbon ##iferous . Recent analyses place D ##end ##r ##er ##pet ##ont ##idae outside Ed ##op ##o ##idea in a more derived position . Other primitive tem ##n ##ospond ##yls include Cap ##etus and Iber ##ospond ##ylus . Sah ##ar ##ast ##ega and Niger ##p ##eton , both described in 2005 from Niger , are also primitive yet come from the Late Perm ##ian . They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record .
In 2000 , paleont ##ologists Adam Yates and Anne Warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , naming several new cl ##ades . Two major cl ##ades were E ##usk ##elia and Lim ##n ##arch ##ia . E ##usk ##elia includes the tem ##n ##ospond ##yls that were once called rh ##ach ##it ##omes and includes two sub ##fam ##ilies , the Diss ##or ##oph ##o ##idea and the E ##ry ##op ##o ##idea . Diss ##or ##oph ##oids include small , mostly terrestrial tem ##n ##ospond ##yls that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians . E ##ry ##op ##oids include larger tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like E ##ry ##ops . The second major clade , Lim ##n ##arch ##ia , includes most Mes ##ozoic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , as well as some Perm ##ian groups . Within Lim ##n ##arch ##ia are the super ##family Ar ##che ##g ##osau ##ro ##idea and the most derived tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , the stere ##ospond ##yls .
Yates and Warren also named D ##vin ##osaur ##ia , a clade of small aquatic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls from the Carbon ##iferous , Perm ##ian , and Triassic . They placed D ##vin ##osaur ##ia within Lim ##n ##arch ##ia , but more recent studies disagree on their position . For example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than e ##usk ##el ##ians , while a 2008 study keeps them as basal lim ##n ##arch ##ians .
Within Stere ##ospond ##yl ##i , Yates and Warren erected two major cl ##ades : Cap ##it ##osaur ##ia and Trem ##at ##osaur ##ia . Cap ##it ##osaurs include large sem ##ia ##qu ##atic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull . Trem ##at ##osaurs include a diversity of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , including large marine tre ##mat ##osau ##ro ##ids , aquatic plag ##iosa ##urs , brachy ##op ##oids that survived into the Cretaceous , and met ##op ##osau ##ro ##ids with eyes near the front of their heads . In 2000 , paleont ##ologists Rain ##er Sch ##och and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of stere ##ospond ##yls , the Rhy ##t ##id ##ost ##ea . This group included more primitive stere ##ospond ##yls that could not be placed in either Cap ##it ##osaur ##ia or Trem ##at ##osaur ##ia , and included groups like Ly ##de ##k ##ker ##in ##idae , Rhy ##t ##id ##ost ##e ##idae , and Br ##achy ##op ##o ##idea . While Cap ##it ##osaur ##ia and Trem ##at ##osaur ##ia are still widely used , Rhy ##t ##id ##ost ##ea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses . Rhy ##t ##id ##ost ##e ##ids and brachy ##op ##oids are now grouped with tre ##mat ##osaur ##ians , but ly ##de ##k ##ker ##in ##ids are still considered to be a primitive family of stere ##ospond ##yls .
A new phylogeny of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls was offered by paleontologist Rain ##er Sch ##och in 2013 . It supported many of the cl ##ades that were found by Yates and Warren , but it did not find support for their division of derived stere ##ospond ##yls into E ##usk ##elia and Lim ##n ##arch ##ia . E ##ry ##op ##ids were found to be more closely related to stere ##ospond ##yls than to diss ##or ##oph ##oids , which were grouped with d ##vin ##osaurs . The clade including E ##ry ##op ##idae and Stere ##ospond ##yl ##omorph ##a was named E ##ry ##op ##iformes . In addition , Sch ##och named the clade containing all tem ##n ##ospond ##yls except ed ##op ##oids E ##ut ##emn ##ospond ##yl ##i and reinstated the name Rh ##ach ##it ##omi for the clade containing all tem ##n ##ospond ##yls except ed ##op ##oids and de ##nd ##r ##er ##pet ##ont ##ids . Below is the clad ##ogram from Sch ##och ' s analysis :
= = = Relationship to modern amphibians = = =
Modern amphibians ( frogs , salamanders , and ca ##ec ##ilians ) are classified in L ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ia . L ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ians appear to have arisen in the Perm ##ian . Molecular clock estimates place the first l ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ian in the Late Carbon ##iferous , but the first member of Bat ##rach ##ia ( frogs and salamanders , but not ca ##ec ##ilians ) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle Perm ##ian using the same technique . Using fossil evidence , there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians .
One is that they evolved from diss ##or ##oph ##oid tem ##n ##ospond ##yls . Another is that they evolved from le ##p ##ospond ##yls , most likely the ly ##s ##or ##oph ##ians . A third hypothesis is that ca ##ec ##ilians descended from le ##p ##ospond ##yls and frogs and salamanders evolved from diss ##or ##oph ##oids .
Recently , the theory that tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were the ancestors of all l ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ians has gained wide support . The skull morphology of some small tem ##n ##ospond ##yls has been compared to those of modern frogs and salamanders , but the presence of bic ##usp ##id , ped ##ic ##ellate teeth in small , pa ##edom ##orph ##ic or immature tem ##n ##ospond ##yls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the tem ##n ##ospond ##yl origin of l ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ians . S ##een in l ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ians and many diss ##or ##oph ##oid tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , ped ##ic ##ellate teeth have calc ##ified tips and bases . During the development of most tet ##rap ##ods , teeth begin to calc ##ify at their tips . Calc ##ification normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth , but calc ##ification from the tip stops abruptly in ped ##ic ##ellate teeth . Calc ##ification resumes at the base , leaving an area in the center of the tooth unc ##alc ##ified . This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils .
The diss ##or ##oph ##oid family Amphib ##am ##idae is thought to be most closely related to L ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ia . In 2008 , an amphib ##am ##id called Ger ##ob ##at ##r ##achus hot ##ton ##i was named from Texas and was nicknamed the " frog ##am ##ander " for its frog @ - @ like head and salamander @ - @ like body . It was thought to be the most closely related tem ##n ##ospond ##yl to l ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ians and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis . Another species of amphib ##am ##id called D ##oles ##er ##p ##eton ann ##ect ##ens is now thought to be even more closely related to l ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ians . Unlike Ger ##ob ##at ##r ##achus , D ##oles ##er ##p ##eton was known since 1969 , and the presence of ped ##ic ##ellate teeth in its jaws has led some paleont ##ologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians . It was first described as a " prot ##ol ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ian " , and the specific name ann ##ect ##ens means " connecting " in reference to its inferred transitional position between tem ##n ##ospond ##yls and l ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ians . The structure of its ty ##mp ##an ##um , a disk @ - @ like membrane that functions like an ear drum , is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship . Other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull , the short ribs , and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of l ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ians than is Ger ##ob ##at ##r ##achus . Below is a clad ##ogram modified from Sigurd ##sen and Bolt ( 2010 ) showing the relationships of Ger ##ob ##at ##r ##achus , D ##oles ##er ##p ##eton , and L ##iss ##amp ##hib ##ia :

= = = Feeding = = =
Although the earliest tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were primarily sem ##ia ##qu ##atic , they had the ability to feed on land . Later , e ##ry ##op ##oids and diss ##or ##oph ##oids , some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed on land . Some e ##ry ##op ##oids became better adapted toward life in water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms . The first primarily aquatic feed ##ers were arche ##g ##osaurs in the Perm ##ian . Trem ##at ##osaurs and capit ##osaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding .
Most aquatic stere ##ospond ##yls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plag ##ios ##aur ##id Ger ##ro ##th ##orax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Ger ##ro ##th ##orax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flex ##ing of the at ##l ##anto @ - @ occ ##ip ##ital joint between the occ ##ip ##ital cond ##yles of the skull and the at ##las verteb ##ra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quad ##rate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protr ##ude outward . Other stere ##ospond ##yls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D . M . S . Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in tem ##n ##ospond ##yls . He envisioned that Mast ##od ##ons ##aurus , a much larger tem ##n ##ospond ##yl than Ger ##ro ##th ##orax , was able to make the same movement . Pale ##ont ##ologist A . L . Panc ##hen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Bat ##rach ##os ##uchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these tem ##n ##ospond ##yls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral gird ##le . Pl ##ag ##ios ##uchus , a close relative of Ger ##ro ##th ##orax , also has a hy ##ob ##r ##anch ##ial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Pl ##ag ##ios ##uchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could su ##ction feed by rapidly opening its mouth .
Unlike sem ##ia ##qu ##atic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , terrestrial tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have skulls that are adapted for biting land @ - @ living prey . The s ##ut ##ures between the bones of the skull in the diss ##or ##oph ##oid Ph ##oner ##p ##eton are able to withstand a high degree of compression . Com ##press ##ive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey . Earlier aquatic tet ##rap ##ods and tet ##rap ##od ancestors differ from tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like Ph ##oner ##p ##eton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension . This tension would have been experienced during su ##ction feeding underwater . Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like Ph ##oner ##p ##eton were among the first tet ##rap ##ods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting .
= = = Reproduction = = =
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Most tem ##n ##ospond ##yls probably reproduced through external fertil ##ization . Like most living frogs , female tem ##n ##ospond ##yls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertil ##ize them . Several fossils were described from the Early Perm ##ian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of diss ##or ##oph ##oid tem ##n ##ospond ##yls . They were the first known fossils of amphib ##ian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vit ##ell ##ine membranes and halo @ - @ like areas surrounding them that are most likely muc ##ous coat ##ings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these tem ##n ##ospond ##yls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The muc ##ous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack muc ##ous ) , but the type of amphib ##ian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from diss ##or ##oph ##oids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found .
One tem ##n ##ospond ##yl , the d ##vin ##osaur Tr ##imer ##or ##h ##ach ##is , may have bro ##oded young in an area between the gills called the ph ##aryn ##ge ##al pouch . Small bones belonging to younger Tr ##imer ##or ##h ##ach ##is individuals have been found in these p ##ou ##ches . The living Darwin ' s Frog is also a mouth bro ##oder and would be the closest modern analogue to Tr ##imer ##or ##h ##ach ##is if it cared for its young in this way . An alternative possibility is that Tr ##imer ##or ##h ##ach ##is was cannibal ##istic , eating its young like many amphibians do today . If this was the case , the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the ph ##aryn ##ge ##al pouch as the animal fossil ##ized .
Body impressions of Early Carbon ##iferous tem ##n ##ospond ##yls from Pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial tem ##n ##ospond ##yls m ##ated on land like some modern amphibians . They reproduced through internal fertil ##ization rather than mating in water . The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were greg ##arious . The head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display . Internal fertil ##ization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders .
= = = Growth = = =
While most types of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are distinguished on the basis of features in mature specimens , several are known from juvenile and larval specimens . Metamorph ##osis is seen in diss ##or ##oph ##oids , e ##ry ##op ##ids , and z ##at ##rach ##yd ##ids , with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land . Several types of diss ##or ##oph ##oids do not fully metamorph ##ose , but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as ne ##ot ##en ##y . D ##vin ##osaur ##ians and the plag ##ios ##aur ##id Ger ##ro ##th ##orax were also ne ##ot ##enic because they retained gills , but they are only known from adult specimens .
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yl larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a hy ##ob ##r ##anch ##ial apparatus , a series of bones that gills would attach to in life . However , some fully mature tem ##n ##ospond ##yls also possess hy ##ob ##r ##anch ##ial bones but did not have external gills . A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults . Major body changes occur in metamorphosis , including the resh ##aping and strengthening of skull bones , the thick ##ening of postc ##ran ##ial bones , and an increase in body size .
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like Sc ##ler ##o ##cephalus are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae , showing an extreme change in body shape . In these species , the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development . The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time . Small , regularly spaced pits are the first to form , followed by larger ridges . As development continues , the external gills disappear . Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost . The postc ##ran ##ial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull , with o ##ss ##ification ( the replacement of cartilage by bone ) happening more slowly . Vert ##eb ##rae and limb bones are poorly developed , ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages , and the sc ##apul ##oc ##or ##ac ##oid and is ##ch ##ium are entirely absent through most of development . Once maturity is reached , most bones have fully formed and growth rate sl ##ows . The bones of some tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like Dut ##uit ##osaurus show growth marks , possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons . Foss ##ils of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like Met ##op ##osaurus and Chel ##ider ##p ##eton show that individuals grew larger past maturity . The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sul ##ci .
One group of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , the Branch ##ios ##aur ##idae , is also known from larval specimens . Branch ##ios ##aur ##ids like Branch ##ios ##aurus and Ap ##ate ##on are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills . An entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens , but the lack of ter ##rest ##ri ##ally adapted adult forms suggests that these tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were ne ##ot ##enic . Unlike other tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , their postc ##ran ##ial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartil ##ag ##inous when fully mature . Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles . Recently , large specimens of Ap ##ate ##on grac ##ilis were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle , indicating that not all branch ##iosa ##urs were ne ##ot ##enic .
While most tem ##n ##ospond ##yls are aquatic in early stages of life , most met ##op ##osaurids appear to have been terrestrial in their juvenile stage . Like other Mes ##ozoic tem ##n ##ospond ##yls , adult met ##op ##osaurids were adapted to a sem ##ia ##qu ##atic lifestyle . Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land . The cross @ - @ section ##al thickness of limb bones in adult met ##op ##osaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion . Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress , and could probably move about on land . To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle , a tem ##n ##ospond ##yl ' s limb bones would have to thick ##en with positive all ##ometry , meaning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body . This is not the case in met ##op ##osaurids , meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle .
= = = Hear ##ing = = =
Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls and other early tet ##rap ##ods have rounded o ##tic not ##ches in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region . In life , the o ##tic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the ty ##mp ##an ##um , which is seen as a disk @ - @ like area in living frogs . The ty ##mp ##an ##um is involved in hearing , and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tet ##rap ##ods . It was traditionally thought that the ty ##mp ##an ##um developed very early in tet ##rap ##od evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of am ##n ##iot ##es . Thus , tem ##n ##ospond ##yls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles .
Frog ##s and all other living tet ##rap ##ods have a rod @ - @ like bone called the st ##apes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum — or homologous ty ##mp ##an ##um — to the inner ear . Tem ##n ##ospond ##yls also have a st ##apes , which projects into the o ##tic cavity . The st ##apes likely evolved from the hy ##om ##and ##ib ##ula of lobe @ - @ fin ##ned fishes . The positioning of the st ##apes and the shape of the o ##tic region suggests that the ty ##mp ##ani of tem ##n ##ospond ##yls and frogs are homologous , but the ty ##mp ##ani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles , birds , and mammals . Therefore , ear structures in tem ##n ##ospond ##yls were not ancestral to those of all other tet ##rap ##ods .
The ability of the ty ##mp ##an ##um and st ##apes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching . Early tet ##rap ##ods like tem ##n ##ospond ##yls have thick st ##apes with poor impedance matching , so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing . Instead , these thick st ##apes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the o ##tic notch . Early tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like D ##end ##r ##er ##p ##eton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground . Later tem ##n ##ospond ##yls like D ##oles ##er ##p ##eton had o ##tic regions adapted to hearing . D ##oles ##er ##p ##eton has a structure in the inner ear called the per ##ily ##mph ##atic duct , which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing . Its st ##apes is also a better transmitter of sound . The hearing system of D ##oles ##er ##p ##eton and related tem ##n ##ospond ##yls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians .
= Os ##bert de Bay ##eux =
Os ##bert de Bay ##eux ( flor ##uit 112 ##1 to 118 ##4 ) was a medieval English cler ##ic and arch ##deacon in the Diocese of York . A relative of Thur ##stan , the Archbishop of York , Os ##bert probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative . After Thur ##stan ' s death , Os ##bert was opposed to one of the candidates for the archbishop ##ric , William f ##itz ##H ##er ##bert , and worked to secure f ##itz ##H ##er ##bert ' s deposition and replacement by Henry Murd ##ac . After Murd ##ac ' s death in 115 ##3 , Os ##bert tried to prevent the return of f ##itz ##H ##er ##bert , but these attempts were unsuccessful . When f ##itz ##H ##er ##bert died suddenly in 115 ##4 , Os ##bert was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop . Although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court , he was stripped of his clerical status and became a lay ##man before 115 ##8 . He died after 118 ##4 , perhaps even after 119 ##4 .
= = Early life = =
Os ##bert was first mentioned in the historical record between 112 ##1 and 112 ##8 when he appears in a charter , which although likely a forg ##ery , probably contains an authentic witness list . This document lists him as " Os ##bert arch ##deacon " , which means that he probably held the arch ##deacon ##ry of Richmond . He was the nephew of Thur ##stan , who was Archbishop of York from 111 ##4 to 114 ##0 . Pres ##um ##ably he owed his position as arch ##deacon to his uncle and was probably appointed at a young age . A charter of Thur ##stan ' s , dating to around 113 ##8 , names Os ##bert explicitly as Thur ##stan ' s nephew .
= = Opposition to William f ##itz ##H ##er ##bert = =
Os ##bert was opposed to the election of William f ##itz ##H ##er ##bert as Archbishop of York and supported William ' s rival and successor Henry Murd ##ac . Although he remained a supporter of Murd ##ac after 114 ##7 , he did oppose Murd ##ac ' s interventions in Sel ##by Abbey , where Murd ##ac had deposed one abbot and appointed another . In 115 ##3 , Os ##bert deposed Murd ##ac ' s choice as abbot of Sel ##by and appointed another abbot . Originally , Os ##bert had supported Elias Pay ##nel , Murd ##ac ' s choice for abbot , but then changed his stance and helped with the deposition .
After Murd ##ac ' s death in 115 ##3 , Os ##bert was opposed to William ' s return as archbishop , but was unsuccessful in his attempts to prevent William ' s reapp ##oint ##ment . William died a week after his return to York , however , and Os ##bert , along with Robert of G ##hent , the Dean of York , secured the quick election of the new archbishop , Roger de Pont L ' É ##v ##ê ##que .
= = Poison ##ing accusations = =
Os ##bert was accused of murdering William , specifically by poisoning him through the communion chal ##ice . A fellow cler ##ic , Symph ##orian , who had been a chaplain of the deceased archbishop , brought murder charges against Os ##bert . Symph ##orian obtained a hearing on the charges at a royal council presided over by King Stephen of England at Michael ##mas in 115 ##4 , but Stephen ' s subsequent death prevented a resolution . Os ##bert attempted to have the trial switched to an ecclesiastical court and was supported in his efforts by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury . A trial was finally held in 115 ##6 and Os ##bert ' s accus ##er did not produce any witnesses , but Os ##bert was unable to prove his innocence , prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court . No record of any judgment exists , but Os ##bert apparently appeared before two pop ##es , Adrian IV and Alexander III . A further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judges @ - @ delegate between 117 ##5 and 118 ##0 .
The case attracted commentary by two contemporary writers . John of Salisbury , who was a secretary for Theobald , added information about Os ##bert in a letter to Alexander III on unrelated business . In the section of the letter , John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about Os ##bert , he had failed to secure other clergy willing to swear that he was innocent . Another contemporary , Gilbert Foliot , who was Bishop of Hereford , wrote to the pope to remind him that although Os ##bert ' s accus ##er had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal , this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal .

Os ##bert was no longer arch ##deacon by 115 ##8 , as his successor is attested by that point . Os ##bert , however , continued to call himself " arch ##deacon " even though he held land as a secular lord , including lands in Lacy and Skip ##ton . He also acted as a steward for Hugh de T ##illy . Os ##bert was still alive in 118 ##4 , as he was a witness to a document at York then , and may have been alive as late as 119 ##4 , when Hugh Bard ##ulf was responsible for the farm of Os ##bert ' s lands , as the record of that transaction in the esc ##he ##at roll is unclear if Os ##bert was alive at that time or dead .
Os ##bert had two sons , William de Bay ##eux and Tur ##st ##in de B ##aius . Os ##bert was a benefactor to a number of monasteries , including Drax Priory , Pon ##tef ##ract Priory and Gis ##borough Priory . He also gave land to a hospital in York and to the Templ ##ars and Hosp ##it ##all ##ers .
= Dvorak technique =
The Dvorak technique ( developed between 1969 and 1984 by Vernon Dvorak ) is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity ( which includes tropical depression , tropical storm , and hurricane / typhoon / intense tropical cyclone intens ##ities ) based solely on visible and infrared satellite images . Within the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The primary patterns used are curved band pattern ( T ##1 . 0 @ - @ T ##4 . 5 ) , shear pattern ( T ##1 . 5 @ - @ T ##3 . 5 ) , central dense overcast ( CD ##O ) pattern ( T ##2 . 5 @ - @ T ##5 . 0 ) , central cold cover ( CCC ) pattern , banding eye pattern ( T ##4 . 0 @ - @ T ##4 . 5 ) , and eye pattern ( T ##4 . 5 - T ##8 . 0 ) .
Both the central dense overcast and embedded eye pattern use the size of the CD ##O . The CD ##O pattern intens ##ities start at T ##2 . 5 , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 mph , 65 km / h ) . The shape of the central dense overcast is also considered . The eye pattern utilizes the cold ##ness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and curvature of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @ - @ number . The CCC pattern indicates little development is occurring , despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature .
Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors , including the National Hurricane Center ' s Tropical Analysis and Forec ##ast Branch ( T ##AF ##B ) , the NOAA / NES ##DIS Satellite Analysis Branch ( SA ##B ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Meteorology and Ocean ##ography Command in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .
= = Evolution of the method = =
The initial development of this technique occurred in 1969 by Vernon Dvorak , using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest Pacific ocean . The system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model . As the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s , measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone ' s low @ - @ pressure area . Use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes , using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself . Const ##raints on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s . The central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification , as the original estimates were 5 @ - @ 10 hPa ( 0 @ . @ 15 @ - @ 0 @ . @ 29 inHg ) too low in the Atlantic and up to 20 hPa ( 0 @ . @ 59 inHg ) too high in the northwest Pacific . This led to the development of a separate wind @ - @ pressure relationship for the northwest Pacific , devised by Atkinson and Holliday in 1975 , then modified in 1977 .
As human analysts using the technique lead to subjective bi ##ases , efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs , which have been aided by higher @ - @ resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers . Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can fluct ##uate over time , automated techniques use a six @ - @ hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates . Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998 , which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes ( of hurricane or typhoon strength ) . It still required a manual center placement , keeping some subject ##ivity within the process . By 2004 , an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to object ##ively determine the tropical cyclone ' s center . A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of the trop ##op ##ause and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique .
= = Details of the method = =
In a developing cyclone , the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features , and as they strengthen , they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner . The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if the storm has weakened , maintained its intensity , or strengthened . Various central cloud and banding features are compared with tem ##pl ##ates that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity . If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity ( colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm ) . In each case a " T @ - @ number " ( an abbrev ##iation for Tropical Number ) and a Current Int ##ensity ( CI ) value are assigned to the storm . These measurements range between 1 ( minimum intensity ) and 8 ( maximum intensity ) . The T @ - @ number and CI value are the same except for weakening storms , in which case the CI is higher . For weakening systems , the CI is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12 hours , though research from the National Hurricane Center indicates that six hours is more reasonable . The table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given T @ - @ number . The amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per 24 ‐ hour period is limited to 2 @ . @ 5 T @ - @ numbers per day .

The CD ##O pattern intens ##ities start at T ##2 . 5 , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) ) . The shape of the central dense overcast is also considered . The farther the center is t ##uck ##ed into the CD ##O , the stronger it is deemed . Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) and 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) can have their center of circ ##ulations obscured by cloud ##iness within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge .
The CCC pattern , with its large and quickly developing mass of thick cir ##rus clouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame , indicates little development . When it develops , rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield obsc ##ures the circulation center . While it resembles a CD ##O pattern , it is rarely seen .
The eye pattern utilizes the cold ##ness of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the CD ##O using rapid scan ge ##ost ##ation ##ary satellite imagery , whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half @ - @ hour .
Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and curvature of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @ - @ number .

Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors . These include the National Hurricane Center ' s Tropical Analysis and Forec ##ast Branch ( T ##AF ##B ) , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ' s Satellite Analysis Branch ( SA ##B ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Pacific Meteorology and Ocean ##ography Center in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .
The National Hurricane Center will often quote Dvorak T @ - @ numbers in their tropical cyclone products . The following example is from discussion number 3 of Tropical Depression 24 ( eventually Hurricane Wilm ##a ) of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season :
B ##OT ##H T ##AF ##B AN ##D SA ##B CA ##ME IN W ##IT ##H A DV ##O ##RA ##K S ##AT ##E ##LL ##IT ##E I ##NT ##E ##NS ##IT ##Y EST ##I ##M ##AT ##E OF T ##2 . 5 / 35 K ##T . H ##OW ##EV ##ER . . .

Note that in this case the Dvorak T @ - @ number ( in this case T ##2 . 5 ) was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the NHC decided to set the system ' s intensity .
The Cooper ##ative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies ( CI ##MS ##S ) at the University of Wisconsin – Madison has developed the Object ##ive Dvorak Techn ##ique ( O ##DT ) . This is a modified version of the Dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than subjective human interpretation to arrive at a CI number . This is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms . The China Meteorological Agency ( C ##MA ) is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future . The Indian Meteorological Department ( IMD ) prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) uses the infrared version of Dvorak over the visible imagery version . Hong Kong Observatory and JMA continue to utilize Dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall . Various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for 6 – 12 hours , though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious .
Citizen science site Cyclone Center uses a modified version of the Dvorak technique to categor ##ize post @ - @ 1970 tropical weather .

The most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available . Int ##ensity estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within 5 miles per hour ( 8 @ . @ 0 km / h ) of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time , though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical @ - @ storm force ( 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) ) and weak hurricane - or typhoon @ - @ force ( 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) ) is the least certain . Its overall precision has not always been true , as ref ##in ##ements in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) . The method is internally consistent in that it const ##r ##ains rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity . Some tropical cyclones fluct ##uate in strength more than the 2 @ . @ 5 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule , which can work to the technique ' s disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s . Systems with small eyes near the limb , or edge , of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique , which can be resolved through use of polar @ - @ orbiting satellite imagery . Sub ##tropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using Dvorak , which led to the development of the He ##bert @ - @ Pot ##eat technique in 1975 . Cycl ##ones undergoing extratropical transition , losing their thunderstorm activity , see their intens ##ities underest ##imated using the Dvorak technique . This led to the development of the Miller and L ##ander extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances .

Amos was born in Mac ##cles ##field , Cheshire and was a member of the Crewe Alexandra academy until he was released at the age of 10 . While at Crewe , he also played for another local team , Boll ##ington United , as a centre midfielder . One year later , Amos was playing for his local team against the team at the top of the table , and they needed to win the match to win the league . Amos ' team ' s goalkeeper was injured during the game , and as the tallest on the team , Amos was put in goal ; however , he had also been the team ' s regular penalty t ##aker all season , so when they were awarded a penalty , he went all the way up the pitch to take the kick . He scored , and his team went on to win the game 3 – 2 , together with the league title . After the game , his parents told him that a Manchester United scout had been watching him and that he had been invited for trials . Amos joined Manchester United at the age of 11 .

In his first season at Manchester United , Amos became a regular starter for the club ' s Under @ - @ 13 team , playing in 19 out of 27 matches in the 2001 – 02 season . Amos was named as an unused substitute for the Under @ - @ 18 side for the first time on 8 January 2005 , for a league game against Manchester City . His first appearance for the Under @ - @ 18 ##s came exactly nine months later , on 8 October 2005 , coming on as a substitute for Danny Rose after starting goalkeeper Ron @ - @ Robert Z ##iel ##er was sent off in a 2 – 0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers . He was regularly named as an unused substitute during the 2005 – 06 season – including for two reserve team matches – but became a frequent starter for the Under @ - @ 18 ##s in 2006 – 07 after signing a train ##ee contract in July 2006 . However , he missed the final of the 2006 – 07 FA Youth Cup with a disl ##ocated shoulder .
He retained his place in the Under @ - @ 18 team for 2007 – 08 , in addition to making his debut for the reserve team against Wigan Athletic on 7 November 2007 , and during the season he impressed enough to be selected to go on the first @ - @ team ' s 2008 summer tour of South Africa . Amos was named as a substitute for all three matches of the tour , but did not play . En route back from South Africa , United stopped off in Nigeria to play against Portsmouth on 27 July 2008 , with Amos replacing Tomas ##z Kus ##z ##c ##zak after 76 minutes . He made his competitive first @ - @ team debut on 23 September 2008 in a 3 – 1 win at home to Middlesbrough in the third round of the League Cup .

Clayton Edward Kershaw ( born March 19 , 1988 ) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . A left @ - @ handed starting pitcher , Kershaw has played in the major leagues since 2008 , and his career earned run average ( ERA ) and Wal ##ks and hits per innings pitched average ( W ##H ##IP ) are the lowest among starters in the live @ - @ ball era with a minimum of 1 @ , @ 000 innings pitched . With his Career Hits All ##owed Per Nine In ##nings Pit ##ched average ( 6 @ . @ 64 ) Which is the second lowest in MLB History , a three @ - @ time Cy Young Award winner , the 2014 National League Most Valuable Player and Los Angeles Dodgers All Time Leader in walks and hits per innings pitched ( 1 @ . @ 01 ) and hits allowed per nine innings pitched ( 6 @ . @ 64 ) , Kershaw is considered by many to be the best pitcher in MLB .
Kershaw was drafted seventh overall in the 2006 MLB draft . He worked his way through the Dodgers ' farm system in just one full season , and reached the majors at 20 years old . When he debuted in 2008 , he was the youngest player in MLB , a title he held for one full year . In 2011 , he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award , becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Good ##en in 1985 . Kershaw pitched a no @ - @ hitter on June 18 , 2014 , becoming the 22nd Dod ##ger to do so . Being a left @ - @ handed strike ##out pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers , Kershaw has often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax . He became the first pitcher in history to lead MLB in ERA for four consecutive years when he did so in the 2011 through 2014 seasons .
Off the field , Kershaw is an active participant in volunteer work . He and his wife , Ellen , launched " Kershaw ' s Challenge " and wrote the book Ar ##ise to raise money to build an orphanage in Zamb ##ia . He has been honored with the Roberto Clement ##e Award and the Branch Rickey Award for his humanitarian work .
= = Early life = =
Kershaw was born in Dallas , Texas on March 19 , 1988 . His parents divorced when he was 10 , and he was raised by his mother . He played in youth sports leagues as a child , including Little League Baseball .
Kershaw attended nearby Highland Park High School , where he played baseball and was also the center for quarterback Matthew Stafford on the football varsity . After a growth sp ##urt and further development of his pitches , he established himself as an elite high school prospect in 2006 when he posted a 13 – 0 record with an earned run average ( ERA ) of 0 @ . @ 77 , and recorded 139 strikeouts in 64 innings pitched . In a playoff game against Northwest High School of Justin , Texas , Kershaw pitched an all @ - @ strike ##out perfect game . He struck out all 15 batters he faced in the game , which was shortened because of the mercy rule . He also pitched for USA Baseball ' s Junior National Team in the Pan Am Championship . Kershaw was selected by USA Today as " High School Baseball Player of the Year " , and was also the Gator ##ade National Player of the Year for baseball .
Entering the 2006 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) draft , Kershaw was considered the top high @ - @ school pitcher available . The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Kershaw with the seventh overall pick in the draft . He had committed to Texas A & M University , but turned down the scholarship offer to sign with the Dodgers , with a bonus estimated at $ 2 @ . @ 3 million . The bonus was the largest to any Dodgers draft pick at the time , and was eventually topped by Zach Lee in the 2010 draft .

Kershaw began his career with the Gulf Coast League ( GC ##L ) Dodgers . He pitched in 37 innings in which he struck out 54 batters ( walking only 5 ) , while compiling a record of 2 – 0 with a 1 @ . @ 95 ERA . He featured a fastball that topped out at 96 miles per hour ( 154 km / h ) and he was rated as the top prospect in the GC ##L , and the Dodgers ' second best prospect by Baseball America behind third baseman Andy LaR ##oche .
Kershaw was promoted to the Great Lakes Lo ##ons in 2007 , where he recorded a record of 7 – 5 with a 2 @ . @ 77 ERA . He was selected to play on the East Team in the Midwest League All @ - @ Star Game and on the USA team in the All @ - @ Star Fut ##ures Game . On August 6 , he was promoted to the Double @ - @ A Jacksonville Suns in the Southern League , where he produced a 1 – 2 record and 3 @ . @ 65 ERA in five starts and was selected as the top prospect in the Dodgers organization heading into the 2008 season .
During spring training in a game against the Boston Red Sox , Kershaw gained much attention for throwing a curv ##eball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey but at the end loop ##ed into the strike zone and struck him out looking . Kershaw was 0 – 3 and had a 2 @ . @ 28 ERA with 47 strikeouts through 43 ##1 ⁄ 3 innings pitched in his first stint of the year with the Suns . He was then called up to the majors on May 28 , 2008 , but option ##ed back to Jacksonville on July 2 .
Kershaw pitched 18 innings during his second trip to Jacksonville ( two starts and one seven inning relief appearance ) , winning two games . During this stretch , he allowed only two runs earned runs , lowering his ERA to 1 @ . @ 91 . He was recalled on July 22 .

Sports ##writer Tony Jackson called Kershaw ' s debut the most anticipated start by a Dodgers pitcher since H ##ideo N ##omo ' s major league debut during the 1995 season . He made his debut on May 25 , starting against the St . Louis Cardinals . He struck out the first batter he faced , Skip Schum ##aker , the first of seven strikeouts in the game , in which he pitched six innings and allowed two runs . When he debuted , Kershaw was the youngest player in MLB , a title he held for one full year .
Kershaw won his first major league game against the Washington Nationals on July 27 , 2008 . He pitched six @ - @ plus shutout innings , allowing four hits , a walk , and he struck out five . Kershaw finished his rookie season 5 – 5 , with a 4 @ . @ 26 ERA in 22 games ( 21 starts ) . He also pitched two innings out of the bullpen for the Dodgers in the 2008 National League Championship Series ( N ##LCS ) against the Philadelphia Phillies .
On April 15 , 2009 , Kershaw pitched seven innings , striking out 13 batters while allowing only one hit ( a solo home run ) against the rival San Francisco Giants . He was the youngest Dod ##ger to ever strike ##out 13 or more batters in a game since Sandy Koufax did it in the 1955 season . On May 17 , 2009 , Kershaw did not allow a hit against the Florida Marlins through 7 innings , then gave up a lead @ - @ off double to Florida ' s Cody Ross . In 2009 , despite an 8 – 8 record , he led the major leagues in opposing batting average ( . 200 ) , opposing slugging percentage ( . 282 ) , and hits per nine innings ( 6 @ . @ 26 ) . He also posted an ERA of 2 @ . @ 79 and 185 strikeouts . Kershaw also walked 91 batters , which was second most in the National League ( NL ) .
Kershaw made his playoff starting debut against the St . Louis Cardinals in the 2009 National League Division Series ( NL ##DS ) . He went 62 ⁄ 3 innings , striking out 4 , walking 1 , and ended up getting a no @ - @ decision ( the Dodgers went on to win the game in the 9th inning ) . At 21 years old , he started the opener of the 2009 N ##LCS against the Philadelphia Phillies and was the third youngest pitcher to ever start a playoff series opener , behind only Fernando Val ##enz ##uel ##a in the 1981 NL ##DS and Rick An ##ki ##el in the 2000 NL ##DS .
Kershaw started the 2010 season by posting a 3 @ . @ 07 ERA in April , but did so by walking 22 batters in 29 innings . On May 4 , he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dod ##ger Stadium , throwing just 57 pitches in 11 ⁄ 3 innings , while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced — including the pitcher . He was boo ##ed loudly upon being pulled from the game . Kershaw said after the game , " I didn ' t give our team any kind of chance .

= = Pitch ##ing style = =
Kershaw ' s pitching style relies on deception . He keeps the ball hidden so that it is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent over ##hand delivery on all of his pitches . Out of the win ##dup , Kershaw low ##ers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate . The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a " kick ##stand move " drawing comparison with one setting a kick ##stand on a bicycle . Out of the stretch , he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him . He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up , Roger Clem ##ens .
Kershaw ' s repertoire includes a four @ - @ seam fastball that sits anywhere from 92 miles per hour ( 148 km / h ) to 95 miles per hour ( 153 km / h ) and tops out at 98 miles per hour ( 158 km / h ) with late movement , a sl ##ider at 84 miles per hour ( 135 km / h ) – 87 miles per hour ( 140 km / h ) , a 12 – 6 curv ##eball between 72 miles per hour ( 116 km / h ) – 76 miles per hour ( 122 km / h ) , and a seldom thrown change ##up ( under 3 % ) . As of late in the 2015 season , he is believed to be experimenting with the use of a cutter . He is also known for having one of the better pick ##off moves to first base and is considered one of the better fielding pitchers in the game .

According to many teammates , Kershaw is a noted perfection ##ist . A . J . Ellis describes his preparation and perfection ##ism during bull ##p ##ens before each start :

Joseph ##a Pet ##rick Kem ##arre is an An ##mat ##yer ##re @ - @ speaking Indigenous Australian , born around 1945 or 1953 at the Santa Teresa Mission , near Alice Springs in Australia ' s Northern Territory .
When Joseph ##a Pet ##rick began painting for M ##b ##ant ##ua Gallery in central Australia , she indicated that her name was Joseph ##a rather than Jos ##ie , and that this was how she hence ##forth wished to be known ; however M ##b ##ant ##ua ' s biography is the only source that has used that version of her name .
After marrying Robin Pet ##y ##arre , brother of artist Gloria Pet ##y ##arre , Joseph ##a Pet ##rick moved to the region of Ut ##opia , north @ - @ east of Alice Springs , which is where she was living when she began painting around 1990 . They had seven children , one of whom , Damien Pet ##rick , went on to become an artist like his mother .

Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Pap ##un ##ya created murals and can ##v ##ases using western art materials , assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bard ##on . Their work , which used ac ##ryl ##ic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures , rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia , particularly after the introduction of a government @ - @ sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983 . By the 1980s and ' 90s , such work was being exhibited internationally . The first artists , including all of the founders of the Pap ##un ##ya T ##ula artists ' company , were men , and there was resistance among the P ##int ##up ##i men of central Australia to women also painting . However , many of the women wished to participate , and in the 1990s many of them began to paint . In the western desert communities such as Ut ##opia , K ##int ##ore , Yue ##ndum ##u , Bal ##go , and on the outst ##ations , people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale .
= = = Career = = =
Joseph ##a Pet ##rick began painting about 1990 or 1992 as part of the contemporary Indigenous art movement that had begun at Pap ##un ##ya in the 1970s . By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions , such as Charles St ##urt University , and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria . Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria ' s 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue ; her painting was printed opposite that of Y ##ann ##ima Tommy Watson , who was by this time famous , particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Mus ##ée du qu ##ai Bran ##ly . Pet ##rick ' s paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong , as well as at the Australian embassy in Washington in 2001 .
In 2006 a commissioned work by Pet ##rick was exhibited at Sh ##alom College at the University of New South Wales as part of a charity fundraising exhibition . It sold for A $ 22 @ , @ 000 . As of the end of 2008 , the highest recorded auction price for an item of Pet ##rick ' s work was $ 22 @ , @ 800 , set in May 2007 . An image based on a triptych by Pet ##rick , Bush Ber ##ries , appears on the cover of a book on the visual perception of motion , Motion Vision .
Central Australian artists frequently paint particular " dream ##ings " , or stories , for which they have responsibility or rights . These stories are used to pass " important knowledge , cultural values and belief systems " from generation to generation . Paint ##ings by Pet ##rick portray two different groups of dream ##ings , rendered in two distinct styles . Bush plum dream ##ing represents a plant of the central Australian desert which is " a source of physical and spiritual sust ##en ##ance , rem ##inding [ the local Indigenous people ] of the sacred ##ness of [ their ] country " . These paintings are undertaken with red , blue and orange dots that represent the fruit at different stages in its development . She also paints women ’ s ceremonies ( Aw ##ely ##e ) and dream ##ings , and these are created using rows of coloured dots and include representations of women ' s ceremonial iconography .
Journalist Zelda C ##aw ##th ##orne described Pet ##rick as one of the " finest contemporary Aboriginal artists " . Art consultant Adrian New ##stead has ranked her as amongst the country ' s top 200 Indigenous artists , noting that she has become " known for innovative works that create a sense of visual harmony through fine var ##ieg ##ated fields of imm ##ac ##ul ##ately applied dot ##ting " . Her style is described by Indigenous art writers Bir ##nberg and K ##rec ##z ##mans ##ki as an " interesting , modern interpretation of landscape " .
Pet ##rick ' s work is held in a variety of public and private collections , including Art ##bank , the Charles St ##urt University Collection , the Holmes a Court Collection , and the National Gallery of Victoria .
= Head VI =
Head VI is an oil @ - @ on @ - @ canvas painting by the Irish @ - @ born English figur ##ative artist Francis Bacon , the last of six panels making up his " 1949 Head " series . It shows a bust view of a single figure , modeled on Diego Vel ##ázquez ' s Portrait of Innocent X . Bacon applies forceful , expressive brush strokes , and places the figure within a glass cage structure , behind curtain @ - @ like dr ##ap ##ery . This gives the effect of a man trapped and suff ##ocated by his surroundings , screaming into an air ##less void .
Head VI was the first of Bacon ' s paintings to reference Vel ##ázquez , whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of " screaming pop ##es " , a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works . Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon ' s work . The hanging object , which may be a light switch or curtain t ##ass ##el , can be found even in his late paintings . The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985 – 86 masterpiece , Study for a Self @ - @ Portrait — T ##ript ##ych .
Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London , in a showing organised by one of the artist ' s early champions , Erica Bra ##us ##en . At the time , Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist , best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Fig ##ures at the Base of a Cruc ##ifix ##ion , which made him the en ##fant terrible of British art . Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics ; John Russell , later Bacon ' s biographer , at the time dismissed it as a cross between " an alligator sh ##orn of its jaws and an account ##ant in p ##ince @ - @ ne ##z who has come to a bad end " . In 1989 Lawrence G ##owing wrote that the " shock of the picture , when it was seen with a whole series of heads . . . was ind ##esc ##rib ##able . It was everything unp ##ard ##on ##able . The paradox ##ical appearance at once of past ##iche and icon ##ocl ##asm was indeed one of Bacon ' s most original strokes . " Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon ' s unusually productive 1949 – 50 period , and one of Bacon ' s finest pop ##es .
= = 1949 Head series = =
Bacon ' s output is characterised by sequences of images . He told Sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that " images breed other images in me " . His series were not always planned or painted in sequence ; sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone . The idea for the head series came after he returned penn ##il ##ess , late in 1948 , from a stay in Tang ##ier . In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice ; the last surviving canvas from this period is his Pain ##ting ( 1946 ) . Although he continued to paint , he was a ruthless self critic , given to sl ##ashing can ##v ##ases with blades , and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948 . Gall ##er ##ist Erica Bra ##us ##en offered Bacon the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new Hanover Gallery . He agreed , but had nothing in reserve to hang . In following years , Bra ##us ##en became perhaps the most important of Bacon ' s early champions ; she arranged this showing — his debut solo exhibition — public ##ised him widely and organised view ##ings for international buyers .
Already 40 years old , Bacon viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination . Because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years , he had little choice but to present new works . He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show , but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year , and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition , completing the series barely in time for the opening .
The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undef ##ined , overwhelmingly cl ##a ##ust ##roph ##obic , redu ##ctive and eerie . Coming early in Bacon ' s career , they are uneven in quality , but show a clear progression especially in how they util ##ise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with . Head I ( actually begun in the winter of 1948 ) and Head II show form ##less pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads ; they have half @ - @ open eyes and a ph ##aryn ##x , though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human . Heads III , IV and V show fully formed bust ##s recognisable as men , and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere . These two broad ideas coales ##ce in Head VI , which is as physi ##ologically tortured as the first two paintings , and as spectral as the middle three . In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vest ##ments , the first indication in Bacon ' s work of the influence of Vel ##ázquez , while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream .
Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge . This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in So ##ho cas ##inos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas " in a bad mood of drinking . . . under tremendous hang ##overs and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . " He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @ - @ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intert ##wined ; he said that " perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit fre ##er . " This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather mor ##bid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a rework ##ing of Vel ##ázquez master ##pieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccup ##y Bacon for the subsequent 20 years .
The series marks Bacon ' s first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms . For him , the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated , un ##obs ##erved , and had abandoned the need to present an outward face . He believed that under these circumstances all pret ##ence falls away , and the social being becomes the sum of its neu ##ros ##es , which Bacon attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare @ - @ bones features : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw . According to Russell , " the view out front c ##eases to be the only one , and our person is suddenly ad ##rift , fragmented , and subject to strange mutation . " Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting , the figures are always posed , and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed . This conce ##it is abandoned in Bacon ' s series .
Head I , completed late in 1948 , is considered more successful than Head II . Although it is well @ - @ regarded critically , Head II is seen as something of a creative cul @ - @ de @ - @ sac , while Heads III , IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards Head VI . It is exceptional in Bacon ' s o ##e ##uv ##re that works of their relative poor quality survive ; he was ruth ##lessly self @ - @ critical and often sl ##ashed or abandoned can ##v ##asses before they were completed . When pressed again by Bra ##us ##en in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been public ##ising for a year , he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on , including several other pop ##es .
Bra ##us ##en commissioned another showing to be held in 1950 , for which Bacon painted three large pop ##es modelled on Vel ##ázquez ' s portrait . The gallery advertised the show as " Francis Bacon : Three Studies from the Pain ##ting of Innocent X by Vel ##ázquez " , but in the end Bacon was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened .

The figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing . It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three @ - @ dimensional glass cage . This framing device , described by Sylvester as a " space @ - @ frame " , was to feature heavily throughout the artist ' s career . A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case , falling just in front of the pope ' s face and partially covering his eyes . It is too indistinct ##ly drawn to identify with certainty , but given the presence of similar objects in Bacon ' s later works , may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the t ##ass ##el of a curtain ; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist . Apart from its symbolic meaning , it has a compositional function , framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines . Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 T ##ript ##ych , May – June 1973 , where it is clearly a dang ##ling light bulb . For Bacon , these elements were intended to make the figure wa ##ver in and out of sight for the viewer , all ##uding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off , curt ##ains open or closed .
The figure ' s mouth is opened wide as if screaming , an expression Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in Sergei Eisen ##stein ' s Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin . In 1984 , the broadcaster Mel ##v ##yn Bragg asked Bacon about the still , and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physical ##ity of the human mouth . Bacon replied , " I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a Mon ##et landscape though I never succeeded in doing so . " When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed , Bacon said , " It should be all much more colour , should have got more of the interior of the mouth , with all the colours of the interior of the mouth , but I didn ' t happen to get it . " His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of dis ##eased oral cavities bought in a second @ - @ hand book ##shop , kept in his studio and to which he often referred to .
The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure ' s voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in silence . Rue ##ful later in life , Bacon said that he had " wanted to paint the scream more than the horror . I think , if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream . . . more successful " . The work evokes memories of the Second World War . The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prop ##hes ##ying photographs of Adolf Eichmann 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a similar cage . Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though , and stated that he used the device so he could frame and " really see the image – for no other reason . I know it ' s been interpreted as being many other things . " Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio bo ##oths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending cal ##am ##ity . Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Or ##well and referred in interviews to Or ##well ##ian " shouting voices . . . and tre ##mb ##ling hands . . . convey [ ing ] the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation . "

The so @ - @ called " space frame " had already been used by Alberto Giac ##omet ##ti in the 1930s , and the two artists became friends in the 1960s . However Giac ##omet ##ti had by 1949 used it only in surreal ##ist contexts before Bacon ' s adapt ##ion , and in turn influenced his use in " The Cage " of 1950 . A similar two dimensional construct is found in Henry Moore ' s works , notably his " Mag ##u ##ette for King and Queen " , constructed three years after Bacon ' s Head . It is difficult to unt ##angle how these artists influenced and informed each other . What is notable is that Bacon continued to use the motif , with intervals until the end of his life . Sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 Three Studies of the Male Back .
The full @ - @ length golden curtain @ - @ like folds painted in heavy brush strokes are in part influenced by D ##egas but also similar to Tit ##ian ' s 155 ##8 Portrait of Cardinal Fil ##ipp ##o Arch ##into . Bacon adap ##ts the Old Master ' s device to isolate and distance the sit ##ter from the viewer ; the black ground @ - @ paint is visible through the folds , making the separation all the more affecting . Bacon had already used similar forms in his Chicago panel , and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed 1950s works , especially in his " screaming pop ##es " . He became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting , and collected many reprodu ##ctions of works by Tit ##ian and D ##egas in which it is employed . He had begun his career as an interior decor ##ator and designer of furniture and r ##ugs in the mid @ - @ 1930s , and later said that he liked " rooms hung all round with just curt ##ains hung in even folds " . Ve ##ils or curt ##ains appear in Bacon ' s earliest works , notably the 1949 Study from the Human Body , always in portraits and always in front of , rather than behind , the figure .
Head VI is closely modelled on Vel ##ázquez ' s c . 1650 Portrait of Innocent X , today in the Dor ##ia P ##amp ##h ##il ##j Gallery , Rome . Bacon caut ##iously avoided seeing the original , even when he spent three months in Rome in 1954 . Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed , or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination . Yet his fascination was all @ - @ consuming and he reproduced variants of it obs ##ess ##ively for almost two decades ; an examination and homage described as " without parallel in the history of art " . Bacon ' s approach differs to Vel ##ázquez ' s in a number of ways : both artists were expressive , yet Bacon ' s broad brush @ - @ strokes and freedom with paint contrast with Vel ##ázquez ' s tight and controlled treatment . He adap ##ts Vel ##ázquez ' s positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer ' s point of view , elev ##ating and dist ##ancing him . This was already a common technique in commercial , promotional photography but in Bacon ' s hands , Sch ##m ##ied argues , the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to cold ##ly observe .
Although Bacon revered Vel ##ázquez ' s portrait , he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting . In interviews , he said that he saw flaws in Vel ##ázquez ' s work and that he viewed that social structure and order as , according to art historian W ##iel ##and Sch ##m ##ied , " obsolete and decayed " . Bacon ' s approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again , thereby making a s ##ly comment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and contemporary painting . Yet Vel ##ázquez ' s influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting . The sit ##ter ' s pose closely echoes the original , as does the violet and white colour ##ing of his cope , which is built up through broad , thick , brush @ - @ strokes . The influence can be further seen in the gold @ - @ coloured ornaments on the back of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure . Art historian Arm ##in Z ##we ##ite describes the work as a mixture of rever ##ence and subvers ##ion that pays tribute to Vel ##ázquez , while at the same time dec ##onst ##ructs his painting .
Sylvester det ##ects the influence of late works by Tit ##ian in other aspects , especially in the deep and rich colour ##ing , Vel ##ázquez ' s portrayals of Philip IV , and agrees with identification of past ##els of Edgar D ##egas as a source . He believes Bacon borrowed from D ##egas the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what D ##egas described as " shut ##tering " , as seen in the earlier artist ' s After the Bath , Woman drying herself . Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Tit ##ian ' s Portrait of Cardinal Fil ##ipp ##o Arch ##into . He believes the folds serve to " push the viewer back " , creating a distance from the subject , an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting ; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison . Sylvester describes them as an accent ##uation of background vertical ##s into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sit ##ter . In his " Interview ##s with Francis Bacon " series of books , he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant . The artist replied , " Well , it means that the sensation doesn ' t come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps . "
When asked why he was compelled to revis ##it the Vel ##ázquez so often , Bacon replied that he had nothing against pop ##es per se , but merely sought " an excuse to use these colours , and you can ' t give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false f ##au ##ve manner . " Sch ##m ##ied sees Head VI as a reaction against Vel ##ázquez , and a commentary on how the papacy is " obsolete and decayed " , with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secular ##isation . To him , the figure seems to " resist the malt ##reatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order . He screams and grim ##aces , clutch ##ing at arms of his throne . " Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso ' s fig ##uration and handling of paint , especially in Picasso ' s 1930s works ; and suggests that the white bl ##obs around the pope ' s cape may be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a Slip S ##eated in an Arm ##chair .

When Bacon undertook the series late in 1948 he was something of a two @ - @ hit wonder . He had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Fig ##ures at the Base of a Cruc ##ifix ##ion and to a lesser extent with Pain ##ting ( 1946 ) , both of which were highly regarded but viewed as sensational ##ist . The exhibition was a success , and marked his critical breakthrough . Until then , he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance . The full show established him in the minds of critics as , according to Michael Pe ##pp ##i ##att , " more of a force to be reck ##oned with in the contemporary scene " . While some found his images hor ##rifying and un ##ner ##ving , they wrote about him all the same , sealing his reputation as the en ##fant terrible of post @ - @ war British art . The critic for The Observer wrote , " The recent paintings . . . hor ##rifying as they are , cannot be ignored . Techn ##ically they are superb , and the master ##ly handling of large areas of pear ##ly grey , fl ##ushed with a sudden pink or green , only makes me regret the more that the artist ' s gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric " .
Most critics focused on Heads I and VI , remarking favourably on the progression between the two . While some found the inherent violence of the paintings distaste ##ful , Bra ##us ##en was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety , and brought Bacon ' s work to national attention . Pe ##pp ##i ##att notes that the exhibition showed Bacon no longer needed sensational ##ist material to make an impact , and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means , and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought , by presenting his sit ##ter " in a vest ##ig ##ial setting , a cage or [ behind ] a parted curt ##in . . . the rest , the most essential , lay in the manipulation of the infinitely suggestive medium of oil paint " . After the showing Bacon gradually became " less the outsider with an occasional image of hor ##rifying brilliance and more a force to be reck ##oned with on the contemporary scene " . His reputation and the value of his panels rose dramatically , and after the showing he was sought after by European , American and African collectors and galleries , commanding prices as high as £ 400 for single works , unusual for a contemporary British artist of the time .

Head VI was first exhibited at the Hanover Gallery , London , in 1949 . It was acquired by the Arts Council ' s Hayward Gallery in 1952 . The Hayward has loaned it out a number of times since , including for major retrosp ##ectives at the Grand Pal ##ais , Paris in 1971 , and the Hugh Lane Gallery , Dublin , in 2000 .
In May 1996 , the National Gallery took on loan Vel ##ázquez ' s Innocent X portrait and hung it alongside four Bacon paintings ; Head VI , Pope I ( 1951 ) , Pope 1961 and Pope 1965 . Pe ##pp ##i ##att believes that Bacon would have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted , but writes that two , including Head VI , " stood up to it , and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power " .
= Imag ##ism =
Imag ##ism was a movement in early 20th @ - @ century Anglo @ - @ American poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear , sharp language .
Imag ##ism has been described as the most influential movement in English poetry since the activity of the Pre @ - @ Raphael ##ites . As a poetic style it gave Modern ##ism its start in the early 20th century , and is considered to be the first organized Modern ##ist literary movement in the English language . Imag ##ism is sometimes viewed as ' a succession of creative moments ' rather than any continuous or sustained period of development . René Tau ##pin remarked that ' It is more accurate to consider Imag ##ism not as a doctrine , nor even as a poetic school , but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles ' .
The Imag ##ists rejected the sentiment and disc ##urs ##iveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry , in contrast to their contemporaries , the Georgian poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition . In contrast , Imag ##ism called for a return to what were seen as more Classical values , such as direct ##ness of presentation and economy of language , as well as a willingness to experiment with non @ - @ traditional verse forms . Imag ##ists use free verse .
Imag ##ist publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures , both in poetry and in other fields . The Imag ##ist group was centered in London , with members from Great Britain , Ireland and the United States . Somew ##hat unusually for the time , a number of women writers were major Imag ##ist figures .
A characteristic feature of Imag ##ism is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence . This feature mirrors contemporary developments in avant @ - @ garde art , especially Cub ##ism . Although Imag ##ism isol ##ates objects through the use of what Ezra Pound called " luminous details " , Pound ' s I ##de ##ogram ##m ##ic Method of juxtap ##osing concrete instances to express an abstract ##ion is similar to Cub ##ism ' s manner of synthes ##izing multiple perspectives into a single image .

Well @ - @ known poets of the Edwardian era of the 1890s , such as Alfred Austin , Stephen Phillips , and William Watson , had been working very much in the shadow of Tennyson , producing weak im ##itations of the poetry of the Victorian era . They continued to work in this vein into the early years of the 20th century . As the new century opened , Austin was still the serving British Poet La ##ureate , a post which he held up to 1913 . In the century ' s first decade , poetry still had a large audience ; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy ' s The Dyn ##asts , Christina Ross ##etti ' s posthumous Po ##etical Works , Ernest Dow ##son ' s Poems , George Meredith ' s Last Poems , Robert Service ' s Ball ##ads of a Che ##ech ##ako and John M ##ase ##field ' s Ball ##ads and Poems . Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devot ##ing much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage , producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period . In 1907 , the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rud ##yard Kip ##ling .
The origins of Imag ##ism are to be found in two poems , Autumn and A City Sunset by T . E . Hul ##me . These were published in January 1909 by the Po ##ets ' Club in London in a booklet called For Christmas MD ##CC ##CC ##V ##III . Hul ##me was a student of mathematics and philosophy ; he had been involved in the setting up of the club in 1908 and was its first secretary . Around the end of 1908 , he presented his paper A Lecture on Modern Poetry at one of the club ' s meetings . Writing in A . R . Or ##age ' s magazine The New Age , the poet and critic F . S . Flint ( a champion of free verse and modern French poetry ) was highly critical of the club and its publications . From the ensuing debate , Hul ##me and Flint became close friends . In 1909 , Hul ##me left the Po ##ets ' Club and started meeting with Flint and other poets in a new group which Hul ##me referred to as the " Sec ##ession Club " ; they met at the E ##iff ##el Tower restaurant in London ' s So ##ho to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the tank ##a and ha ##iku and the removal of all unnecessary verb ##i ##age from poems . The interest in Japanese verse forms can be placed in a context of the late Victorian and Edwardian revival of interest in Ch ##ino ##iser ##ie and J ##apon ##ism as witnessed in the 1890s v ##ogue for William Anderson ' s Japanese prints donated to the British Museum , performances of Noh plays in London , and the success of Gilbert and Sullivan ' s oper ##etta The Mikado ( 1885 ) . Direct literary models were available from a number of sources , including F . V . Dick ##ins ' s 1866 Hy ##ak n ##in is ' sh ##iu , or , Stan ##z ##as by a Century of Po ##ets , Being Japanese Lyr ##ical Od ##es , the first English @ - @ language version of the Hy ##ak ##un ##in iss ##hu , a 13th @ - @ century anthology of 100 w ##aka , the early 20th @ - @ century critical writings and poems of Sad ##ak ##ichi Hartmann , and contemporary French @ - @ language translations .
The American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to the group in April 1909 and found that their ideas were close to his own . In particular , Pound ' s studies of Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed , direct expression that he detected in the writings of Ar ##na ##ut Daniel , Dante , and Guido Caval ##c ##anti , amongst others . For example , in his 1911 – 12 series of essays I gather the limbs of Osiris , Pound writes of Daniel ' s line " p ##ens ##ar de lie ##is m ' es rep ##aus " ( " it rests me to think of her " ) ( from the can ##zone En bre ##u bri ##z ##ara ' l tem ##ps bra ##us ) : " You cannot get statement simpler than that , or clearer , or less rhet ##orical " . These criteria of direct ##ness , clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imag ##ist poetry . Through his friendship with Laurence B ##iny ##on , Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by examining Nish ##iki @ - @ e prints at the British Museum , and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms .
In an article in La France , 1915 , the French critic , R ##emy de Gour ##mont described the Imag ##ists as descendants of the French Symbol ##ist ##es and in a 1928 letter to the French critic and translator René Tau ##pin , Pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry for Imag ##ism , pointing out that Hul ##me was ind ##eb ##ted to a Symbol ##ist tradition , linking back via William Butler Yeats , Arthur Sym ##ons and the Rhy ##mers ' Club generation of British poets to Mall ##arm ##é . and the Symbol ##ist source was amplified further in Tau ##pin ' s study published in 1929 , in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language ' between the image of the Imag ##ist and the ' symbol ' of the Symbol ##ists there is a difference only of precision ' . In 1915 , Pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet , Lionel Johnson for the publisher El ##kin Mathews . In his introduction , he wrote

In 1911 , Pound introduced two other poets to the E ##iff ##el Tower group : his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle ( who had started signing her work H . D . ) and her future husband Richard Ald ##ington . These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models , especially Sapph ##o , an interest that Pound shared . The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto @ - @ Imag ##ist interest in Japanese poetry , and , in 1912 , during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room , Pound told H . D . and Ald ##ington that they were Imag ##ist ##es and even app ##ended the signature H . D . Imag ##iste to some poems they were discussing .
When Harriet Monroe started her Poetry magazine in 1911 , she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor . In October 1912 , he submitted there ##to three poems each by H . D . and Ald ##ington under the Imag ##iste rub ##ric , ( published in the November 1912 second issue thereof ) with a note which described Ald ##ington as ' one of the ' Imag ##ist ##es ' . This note , along with the append ##ix note ( ' The Complete Works of T . S . Hul ##me ' ) in Pound ' s book ( also published in Autumn 1912 ) entitled Rip ##ost ##es are considered to be first appearances of the word Imag ##iste ( later ang ##lic ##ised to ' Imag ##ists ' ) in print .
Ald ##ington ' s poems , Ch ##oric ##os , To a Greek Marble , and Au Vie ##ux Jard ##in , were in the November issue of Poetry , and H . D . ' s , Hermes of the Ways , Pri ##ap ##us , and Ep ##ig ##ram , appeared in the January 1913 issue ; Imag ##ism as a movement was launched . Poetry ' s April issue published what came to be seen as " Imag ##ism ' s enabling text " , the ha ##iku @ - @ like poem of Ezra Pound entitled " In a Station of the Metro " :
The appar ##ition of these faces in the crowd ;
Pet ##als on a wet , black b ##ough .
The March 1913 issue of Poetry contained A Few Don ' ts by an Imag ##iste and the essay entitled Imag ##ism ##e both written by Pound , with the latter being attributed to Flint . The latter contained this succ ##inct statement of the group ' s position :
Direct treatment of the " thing " , whether subjective or objective .
To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation .
As regarding rhythm : to compose in sequence of the musical phrase , not in sequence of the met ##ron ##ome .
Pound ' s note opened with a definition of an image as " that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time " . Pound goes on to state , " It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce vol ##uminous works " . His list of " don ' ts " reinforced his three statements in " Imag ##ism " , while warning that they should not be considered as dog ##ma but as the " result of long contempl ##ation " . Taken together , these two texts comprised the Imag ##ist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past . F . S . Flint commented " we have never claimed to have invented the moon . We do not pretend that our ideas are original . "
The 1916 preface to Some Imag ##ist Po ##ets comments " Imag ##ism does not merely mean the presentation of pictures . Imag ##ism refers to the manner of presentation , not to the subject . "
= = Des Imag ##ist ##es = =
Determ ##ined to promote the work of the Imag ##ists , and particularly of Ald ##ington and H . D . , Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title Des Imag ##ist ##es . It was first published in Alfred K ##rey ##mb ##org ' s little magazine The Gle ##be and was later published in 1914 by Alfred and Charles Bon ##i in New York and by Harold Mon ##ro at the Poetry Book ##shop in London . It became one of the most important and influential English @ - @ language collections of modernist verse . Included in the thirty @ - @ seven poems were ten poems by Ald ##ington , seven by H . D . , and six by Pound . The book also included work by F . S . Flint , Skip ##with Cann ##ell , Amy Lowell , William Carlos Williams , James Joyce , Ford Mad ##ox Ford , Allen Up ##ward and John Cour ##nos . Max Michel ##son was also another included in the important 1963 anthology by William Pratt The Imag ##ist Po ##em Modern Poetry in miniature .
Pound ' s editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imag ##ist pre ##cepts , rather than active participation in a group as such . Williams , who was based in the United States , had not participated in any of the discussions of the E ##iff ##el Tower group . However , he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines . Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound , as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier , Pre @ - @ Raphael ##ite @ - @ influenced style towards a harder , more modern way of writing . The inclusion of a poem by Joyce , I Hear an Army , which was sent to Pound by W . B . Yeats , took on a wider importance in the history of literary modern ##ism , as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication , at Pound ' s behest , of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The E ##go ##ist . Joyce ' s poem is not written in free verse , but in rhy ##ming qu ##at ##r ##ains . However , it strongly reflects Pound ' s interest in poems written to be sung to music , such as those by the troub ##ad ##ours and Guido Caval ##c ##anti . The book met with little popular or critical success , at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do , and a number of copies were returned to the publisher .

The following year , Pound and Flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history of Imag ##ism written by Flint and published in The E ##go ##ist in May 1915 . Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the E ##iff ##el Tower poets , especially Edward St ##orer . Pound , who believed that the " Hellenic hardness " that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H . D . and Ald ##ington was likely to be dil ##uted by the " cust ##ard " of St ##orer , was to play no further direct role in the history of the Imag ##ists . He went on to co @ - @ found the V ##ort ##ic ##ists with his friend , the painter and writer Wy ##nd ##ham Lewis .
Around this time , the American Imag ##ist Amy Lowell moved to London , determined to promote her own work and that of the other Imag ##ist poets . Lowell was a wealthy heiress from Boston whose brother Abbott Lawrence Lowell was President of Harvard University from 1909 @ - @ 1933 . She loved Keats and c ##ig ##ars . She was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group . Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound ' s aut ##ocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner . This new editorial policy was stated in the Pre ##face to the first anthology to appear under her leadership : " In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former Anthology . Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor , each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best , the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form . " The outcome was a series of Imag ##ist anthologies under the title Some Imag ##ist Po ##ets . The first of these appeared in 1915 , planned and assembled mainly by H . D . and Ald ##ington . Two further issues , both edited by Lowell , were published in 1916 and 1917 . These three volumes featured most of the original poets , ( also including imag ##ist poetry by the American poet John Gould Fletcher ) , with the exception of Pound , who had tried to persuade her to drop the Imag ##ist name from her publications and who s ##ard ##on ##ically dubbed this phase of Imag ##ism " Amy @ - @ g ##ism .

Lowell persuaded D . H . Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes , making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imag ##ist . Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period . However , with World War I as a backdrop , the times were not easy for avant @ - @ garde literary movements ( Ald ##ington , for example , spent much of the war at the front ) , and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imag ##ists as a movement .
= = Imag ##ists after Imag ##ism = =
In 1929 , Walter Low ##en ##f ##els jokingly suggested that Ald ##ington should produce a new Imag ##ist anthology . Ald ##ington , by now a successful novelist , took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford and H . D . The result was the Imag ##ist Anthology 1930 , edited by Ald ##ington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell , who had died , Cann ##ell , who had disappeared , and Pound , who declined . The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imag ##ists in the history of 20th @ - @ century poetry .
Of the poets who were published in the various Imag ##ist anthologies , Joyce , Lawrence and Ald ##ington are now primarily remembered and read as novel ##ists . Marianne Moore , who was at most a fringe member of the group , carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an Imag ##ist concern with compression of language . William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken " from the mouths of Polish mothers " . Both Pound and H . D . turned to writing long poems , but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an Imag ##ist legacy . Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of Imag ##ism .
= = Legacy = =
Despite the movement ' s short life , Imag ##ism would deeply influence the course of modernist poetry in English . Richard Ald ##ington , in his 1941 memoir , writes : " I think the poems of Ezra Pound , D . H . , Lawrence , and Ford Mad ##ox Ford will continue to be read . And to a considerable extent T . S . Eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the Imag ##ists . "
On the other hand , Wallace Stevens found shortcomings in the Imag ##ist approach : " Not all objects are equal . The vice of imag ##ism was that it did not recognize this . " With its demand for hardness , clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imag ##ism had later effects that are demonst ##rat ##able in T . S . Eliot ' s ' Pre ##ludes ' and ' Morning at the Window ' and in D . H . Lawrence ' s animal and flower pieces . The rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen @ - @ twenties owed much to the Imag ##ists repud ##iation of the Georgian Poetry style .
The influence of Imag ##ism can be seen clearly in the work of the Object ##ivist poets , who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams . The Object ##iv ##ists worked mainly in free verse . Clear ##ly linking Object ##ivism ' s principles with Imag ##ism ' s , Louis Z ##uk ##ofsky insisted , in his introduction to the 1931 Object ##ivist issue of Poetry , on writing " which is the detail , not mir ##age , of seeing , of thinking with the things as they exist , and of directing them along a line of melody . " Z ##uk ##ofsky was a major influence on the Language poets , who carried the Imag ##ist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development . Basil Bun ##ting , another Object ##ivist poet , was a key figure in the early development of the British Poetry Revival , a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the San Francisco Renaissance poets .
Imag ##ism influenced a number of poetry circles and movements . With the Imag ##ists Free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form . In the 1950s , especially , with the Beat generation , the Black Mountain poets , and others associated with the San Francisco Renaissance . In his seminal 1950 essay Project ##ive V ##erse , Charles Olson , the theorist of the Black Mountain group , wrote " ON ##E P ##ER ##C ##EP ##T ##I ##ON M ##US ##T IM ##ME ##DI ##AT ##EL ##Y AN ##D DI ##R ##EC ##T ##L ##Y LE ##AD TO A FU ##RT ##H ##ER P ##ER ##C ##EP ##T ##I ##ON " ; his cred ##o derived from and supplemented the Imag ##ists .
Among the Beats , Gary Snyder and Allen Gins ##berg in particular were influenced by the Imag ##ist emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry . William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets , encouraging poets like Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Gins ##berg ' s How ##l ( 1955 ) .
= Operation Eastern Exit =
Operation Eastern Exit was the codename given to the military evacuation of the United States embassy in Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia , in January 1991 . In late December 1990 , violence quickly en ##veloped the city as armed militants began cl ##ashing with government soldiers . On 1 January 1991 , the US Ambassador to Somalia , James Ke ##ough Bishop , contacted the Department of State requesting an evacuation of the embassy , which was approved the following day . United States Central Command began planning and mobil ##izing forces that evening . The initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the Mogadishu International Airport , but this was later abandoned . A helicopter evacuation via the USS Guam and USS Trenton was the remaining option .
On the morning of 5 January , a 60 @ - @ person Marine and Navy SEAL security detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH @ - @ 53 ##E Super Stall ##ion helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation . The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 evacuees . Throughout the day , foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy . Four waves of five CH @ - @ 46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January . The evacuees were transported to Mus ##cat , Oman , where they disembarked on 11 January . In total , 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated , including 12 heads of missions ( eight ambassadors and four char ##g ##és d ' affair ##es ) .
= = Background = =
In the late 1980s , there was increasing rebellion against the rule of Somali President Si ##ad Barre , a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses . By 1990 , what began as civil disob ##edience evolved into a civil war , with several militias organized to overthrow the central government .
In July 1989 , the embassy moved to a new , 80 @ - @ acre ( 32 ha ) compound , 6 miles ( 9 @ . @ 7 km ) from the previous embassy and James K . Bishop was appointed as the United States ' ambassador to Somalia . Ambassador Bishop had significant experience in crisis management at US emb ##ass ##ies . In 1967 , he was at the US Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon when the Six @ - @ Day War erupted . About 3 @ , @ 600 Americans were evacuated in 33 hours ; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city . As deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1981 – 87 , Bishop chaired several task forces for crises and gained experience in the State Department ' s operations center as evacuations were carried out during several cou ##ps d ' et ##at . During his previous assignment as Ambassador to Liberia ( 1987 – 90 ) , Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in Liberia spread , when he left in March 1990 . Soon after returning to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia , he was appointed to a task ##force to deal with the crisis in Liberia , which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August .
On 1 August , before leaving the US to take up his post in Mogadishu , Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command — the military command for the Middle East and northeast Africa — where he spent most of the day with its commander , Gen . Norman Schwarz ##k ##opf . Ambassador Bishop , aware of the ongoing strife , believed " the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances . " Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut and Liberia the importance of being prepared to deal with emer ##g ##encies and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy ' s Emer ##g ##encies and Ev ##ac ##uation ( E & E ) plan until he was " satisfied . . . that [ Central Command ] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that . " In its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit , the Center for Naval Analy ##ses cited the Ambassador Bishop ' s previous experience and " clear understanding of his role " in the operation as one of the reasons Operation Eastern Exit went so well .
Hours after Ambassador Bishop ' s visit to Central Command , Iraq invaded Kuwait . In 1979 , the US negotiated access to an airport and port in both Mogadishu and Ber ##ber ##a ; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area , maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait .
An increasing level of criminal violence prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of depend ##ents ( e . g . children and sp ##ouses of staff ) and non @ - @ essential staff in early December , although fighting between the government and the United Somali Congress ( a rebel militia ) remained no less than about 100 miles ( 160 km ) away . The voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation . By 19 December , the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 ; around the same time , fighting between the government and rebels came within about 40 miles ( 64 km ) of Mogadishu .
= = = Coll ##apse of the Barre government = = =
On 30 December , violence escalated " an order of magnitude " as militants entered Mogadishu , which was quickly en ##veloped by a general state of law ##lessness . On 30 – 31 December , diplomats , including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city , were collected and housed in the embassy compound , except two volunteers who remained in the embassy ' s K @ - @ 7 residential apartments located across Af ##g ##oy Road from the embassy . The volunteers in the K @ - @ 7 building would be needed as look @ - @ outs for the embassy compound ' s main gate . On the morning of 31 December , the defense attach ##é was nearly killed when his vehicle was sprayed with bullets and that evening , a soldier at a road ##block shot the tires of a vehicle carrying another defense official . Attempts by the US and other nations ' diplomats , in particular the Italian embassy , to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful . Af ##g ##oy Road became a " shooting gallery , " preventing those in safe @ - @ hav ##ens outside the embassy from reaching it . On New Year ' s Day , the first American civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy .
Ambassador Bishop requested an evacuation of the American community on 1 January , indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned Italian , French , or German evacuation efforts , but preferred an evacuation by the US military . The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and on that day , Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military , thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit . Ambassador Bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing conting ##ency plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts . Ultimately , ten heads of missions — eight ambassadors and two char ##g ##és d ' affair ##es — along with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated .
= = Plans , mobil ##ization , and escalating violence = =
Ambassador Bishop had visited Central Command in August 1990 , where he worked with military experts to update the embassy ' s E & E plan . The first notice that an evacuation of the Mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of 1 January , when the top naval commander at Central Command sent a message to his naval operations staff : " Better have Amphib crowd take a look at a hel ##o NE ##O of Mogadishu ! time / distance to get there from Mas ##ir ##ah O ##P area . " Following the ambassador ' s 2 January evacuation request , the commander of Central Command ordered Air Force aircraft to the region , the movement of amphibious ships to Mogadishu , and requested United States Special Operations Command to prepare for a non ##comb ##at ##ant evacuation operation .
The initial plan was to evacuate via Mogadishu International Airport . Soon after the evacuation request , the United States Air Force deployed C @ - @ 130 transport planes and an AC @ - @ 130 , for gunfire support , to Nai ##rob ##i , Kenya , awaiting clear ##ances to enter Somalia and the ability to safely transfer evacuees from the embassy to the airport . However , the US and other foreign emb ##ass ##ies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clear ##ances . It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command @ - @ and @ - @ control structure , making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage . Likewise , government troops faced a command @ - @ and @ - @ control problem ; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines , in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with . Thus , it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible . Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu , but faced the same problems of landing and transit of evacuees to the airport .
On 4 January , several incidents , including a couple exchanges of gunfire , suggested that the embassy ' s security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Som ##alis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers , at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January . The embassy had just six Marine guards , whose job was limited to protecting the chanc ##ery . Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived . The request was denied , but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning .
USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22 : 30 ( 23 : 30 Oman time ) on 2 January . The commander of Amphib ##ious Group Two had initially proposed a seven @ - @ ship Amphib ##ious Task Group , composed of vessels anchored at Mas ##ir ##ah Island ( off Oman ) and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation . However , intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf , thus the decision to send two of the closest ships . Although the two vessels were selected by mid @ - @ afternoon on 2 January , the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to Mas ##ir ##ah caused a delay of eight to ten hours . Guam and Trenton carried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade , including a detachment of CH @ - @ 53 ##E Super Stall ##ion helicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the US military — and two squadrons of CH @ - @ 46 Sea Knight helicopters .
Planning began in earnest as the ships got underway , with a combined command center on Guam . On the morning of 3 January , the task force ' s command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force ; the request was denied . A warrant officer who had previously served as a Marine Security Guard at the Mogadishu embassy during the mid @ - @ 1980s was found . Despite Ambassador Bishop ' s planning with Central Command , the task force was provided outdated information . The former MS ##G told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior . In fact , the new embassy was located further inland and , after receiving updated information , task force commanders determined that a beach landing , requiring troops to fight their way across the city , was too risky . Initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at 01 : 00 on 7 January . However , in response to indications from Ambassador Bishop that conditions in Mogadishu were deteriorating , planners considered 1 @ , @ 050 @ - @ nautical @ - @ mile ( 1 @ , @ 940 km ; 1 @ , @ 210 mi ) and , later , 890 @ - @ nautical @ - @ mile ( 1 @ , @ 650 km ; 1 @ , @ 020 mi ) flights with the CH @ - @ 53 ##Es while the ships were still located in the northern Arabian Sea . The situation in Mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until 5 January .
= = Ev ##ac ##uation = =
On the evening of 4 January , the final execute order was issued for a 02 : 45 launch of two CH @ - @ 53 ##E Super Stall ##ions to arrive at the embassy at dawn . The 60 soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition . Two Marine Corps KC @ - @ 130 refueling tankers were mobilized closer to the operation , from Bahrain to Oman , to refuel the helicopters en route to Mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from Trenton to Guam .
= = = Security detail and first evacuees = = =
Two CH @ - @ 53 ##E Super Stall ##ions carrying a 60 @ - @ man security detail — 51 Marines and nine Navy SEAL ##s — departed Guam at 02 : 47 , 46 ##6 nautical miles ( 86 ##3 km ; 53 ##6 mi ) from the embassy , and were expected to arrive at 06 : 20 . They performed two aerial refuel ##ings . During the first refueling , a pipe burst on one of the helicopters , d ##ousing soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the Guam ; problems with the helicopters ' navigation system also complicated the refueling rendezvous . The helicopters arrived in Mogadishu at dawn , crossing the coast just south of the harbor at 25 – 50 feet ( 7 @ . @ 6 – 15 @ . @ 2 m ) in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city . On their arrival in Mogadishu , the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map , which showed the embassy in an isolated area . Furthermore , they had been told the embassy could be discern ##ed by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course . The embassy was , in fact , surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city . The helicopters were flying too low to spot a st ##robe light which was placed on the embassy ' s water tower ( the highest point within the embassy compound ) and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black , oil @ - @ coated surface — not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew would recognize . After breaking radio silence ( their only direct communication with the embassy was un ##enc ##ry ##pted ) to contact the embassy , they were able to discern it and land at 07 : 10 . As they arrived , a group of about 100 to 150 Som ##alis were attempting to enter the embassy compound via l ##adders on the wall , but scattered as the helicopters arrived .
The security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the Air Force ' s AC @ - @ 130 arrived to provide overhead support . Ambassador Bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement : they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound ' s walls with obvious hostile intent . He also identified three zones of defense , stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force :
the entire embassy compound
the Chancery , Joint Administrative Office ( J ##A ##O ) building , Marine House , and the helicopter landing zone ( H ##L ##Z )
the chanc ##ery and J ##A ##O buildings ( the two " safe ##haven " buildings where the evacuees were held )
Ambassador Bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail , which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu . He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the US was intervening in the conflict . To this effect , he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict . The Marines who had been d ##oused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes .
After an hour on the ground , the helicopters left with the first 61 evacuees , including all American civilians and four heads of mission . Ev ##ac ##ue ##es were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm . Compl ##ications with the only in @ - @ flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling , which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue . At 9 : 40 , the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees .
= = = Embassy during the day = = =
No threats came upon the embassy during the day , although truck ##load ##s of armed Som ##alis frequently drove by the embassy along Af ##gh ##oy Road . Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy . A sniper and a spot ##ter were positioned on the embassy ' s water tower ( the highest structure in the compound ) and came under fire ; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower .
The Office of Military Cooperation , just one and a half blocks from the embassy , required evacuation . Despite its proximity to the embassy , an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest . A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and SEAL ##s left the embassy at 8 : 47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the O ##MC ( four Americans , a Filipino , and 17 Ken ##y ##ans ) . This was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security detail . Throughout the day , foreign diplomats contacted the embassy des ##iring to be evacuated ; the US welcomed these requests , but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy .
A Somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy , Major Si ##ad , agreed to travel to rescue the German char ##gé d ' affair ##es and British ambassador ( junior staff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy ) . The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; Ambassador Bishop , a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart , agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy . Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January , they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer . At the request of Ambassador Bishop , Major Si ##ad agreed to transport the Soviets , but only if he was paid enough ; the US embassy paid Major Si ##ad , who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff . The brother of President Barre , who was also a Major General and Chief of Police , showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador .
The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ( E ##CC ) , which was set up in the J ##A ##O . A 44 @ - @ person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the E ##CC was planned for insertion with the CH @ - @ 53 ##E Super Stall ##ions after they had returned to the Guam . However , this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail . The deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail . The evacuees were grouped into 15 @ - @ person " sticks " to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece . Some attempted to bring more , resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation . Furthermore , many evacuees had pets they wanted to bring , which were not allowed . Most pets were killed by their owners ; some were given poison . Meanwhile , the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy ' s comm ##iss ##ary , such as candy , sod ##as , and souven ##irs ( most had been stationed on ships for several months ) . They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy ; the medic filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship .
As evening approached , work began to prepare the H ##L ##Z for the main evacuation . The area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated . Some cars had to be broken into to be moved . Chemical lights were placed in the H ##L ##Z in a NATO " Y " pattern . The entire mission would be conducted with night vision g ##ogg ##les , which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off .
= = = Main evacuation = = =
The main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of 6 January and consisted of four waves of five CH @ - @ 46 helicopters . The timing of this phase was determined by range of the CH @ - @ 46 Sea Knight , which lack aerial refueling capability ; the ships were about 350 – 380 nautical miles ( 650 – 700 km ; 400 – 440 mi ) away during this phase . An AC @ - @ 130 was sent from Saudi Arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two UH @ - @ 1 Iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support , but were not deployed .
The first wave departed Guam at 23 : 43 . As the second wave landed , Major Si ##ad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two truck ##load ##s of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other . His request to speak with the ambassador was granted . Major Si ##ad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation . He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued . The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major , who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador ' s armored car . Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneg ##ing on the deal . The final wave departed the embassy at 1 : 49 and landed on Guam at 2 : 23 ; twenty minutes later , Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete .
= = = Aftermath at the embassy = = =
Armed l ##ooters were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed . The doors of the chanc ##ery — the main building of the embassy — were reportedly blown open by RPGs within two hours of the embassy ' s evacuation . Somali employees of the embassy — known as foreign service nationals ( FS ##N ##s ) — could not be evacuated . Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airl ##ifted to safer parts of Somalia . Many of the FS ##N ##s had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal . Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FS ##N ##s . The Ambassador left the FS ##N ##s with keys to the comm ##iss ##ary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed .

A total of 281 evacuees were taken from the embassy , including 12 heads of missions ( eight ambassadors and four char ##g ##és d ' affair ##es ) and 61 Americans ( including Ambassador Bishop and 36 embassy staff ) . The heads of mission were the ambassadors of the United States , Kenya , Nigeria , Soviet Union , Sudan , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , and United Kingdom and the char ##g ##és of the emb ##ass ##ies of Germany , Kuwait , Oman , and Qatar .
Rather than disembark in nearby M ##omb ##asa , as originally thought by the evacuees , the ships were ordered back to Oman — a five @ - @ day journey . The sailors and marines made way for the evacuees to share living quarters . When the chaplain of Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the evacuees while aboard the vessel , two hundred signed up within an hour , and some of the sailors even dressed up as clown ##s to ease the ordeal for children . At the request of the ambassadors , a formal session with the ships ' senior officers was held to express their thanks . On 11 January , the evacuees were off ##load ##ed at Mus ##cat , Oman . That afternoon , the American evacuees were flown to Frankfurt , Germany , from where they continued home .

The 2010 Cl ##ax ##ton Shield was the 57th Cl ##ax ##ton Shield tournament , the premier baseball competition in Australia , and was held from 6 November 2009 to 7 February 2010 . It was hailed as the precursor to the new Australian Baseball League that will start in the place of the Cl ##ax ##ton Shield in late 2010 to early 2011 . The Victoria A ##ces defeated South Australia two games to n ##il in the championship series to win the tournament ; this was the 22nd time the Cl ##ax ##ton Shield had been awarded to a Victorian team . The competition was sponsored by Domino ' s Pizza .
At the conclusion of the regular season , the Victoria A ##ces finished in first place with a 17 – 7 record , earning home @ - @ field advantage for the three @ - @ game championship series . South Australia hosted the three @ - @ game semi @ - @ final series against the New South Wales Patriots . Both teams finished with a 14 – 10 record . The Perth Heat ( 12 – 12 ) and Queensland Rams ( 3 – 21 ) both failed to qualify for the finals .

In June 2009 , it was announced that the rights to the Cl ##ax ##ton Shield had been sold to a new Australian Baseball League ( A ##BL ) , with ownership split between Major League Baseball ' s 75 percent share and the 25 percent share owned by the Australian Baseball Federation . The 2010 tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural A ##BL season starting in 2010 – 11 . It varied from the 2009 Cl ##ax ##ton Shield by expanding the season to include ten rounds . Since an uneven number ( five ) teams were involved , four teams paired off for each round and played a three @ - @ game series , while the remaining team took a bye . During the season , each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team , one at home and one away . In total , the schedule allowed for 24 regular @ - @ season games per team before a postseason similar to the 2009 edition : the first @ - @ place team directly qualified for the championship series and played against the winner of a playoff series between the second - and third @ - @ place teams .
During the regular season , games were played on a Friday night and a double ##head ##er on Saturday ; in each double ##head ##er one of the two games was shortened to seven innings . The exception to this was when Perth played their home games ; they played on a Thursday night instead of a double ##head ##er on Saturday . Each postseason series was scheduled for a Friday , Saturday and Sunday .

Both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season ; make @ - @ up games were scheduled at the start of the return series between the teams , and this resulted in two four @ - @ game series . In both cases , the teams had a 19 @ - @ man roster for the make @ - @ up game , and an expanded 21 @ - @ man roster for the originally scheduled series .

The 2010 Cl ##ax ##ton Shield was contested between five teams from around Australia . In previous years , many of the teams had played their home games at multiple venues . This season each team held their home games at only one venue . There was one scheduled exception to this at the start of the season : the New South Wales Patriots ' final home series against the Perth Heat was held at Gilchrist Oval , whereas all of their other home games were held at Black ##town Baseball Stadium .
As a result of poor attendance at Geelong Baseball Park , game one of the fifth @ - @ round series between New South Wales and the Victoria A ##ces was moved to La Tro ##be University , Melbourne . Although the Geelong games had attracted crowds of no more than 500 , the moved game had an attendance of 2 @ , @ 200 . Though no further regular season games were moved , the finals series hosted by the A ##ces was held at La Tro ##be University as well .
The venues are as follows :

The Queensland Rams were the first team to be eliminated from contention for the finals , after being swept four games to n ##il by the Victoria A ##ces in round 8 . The following round saw South Australia clinch a position in the finals , despite finishing the round in second position . It was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided : the A ##ces clinched top spot by sweeping the Perth Heat , which combined with the New South Wales Patriots sweep of the Rams eliminated Perth from contention and secured the last finals spot for the Patriots .

= Independ ##iente ( Ricardo Arjona album ) =
Independ ##iente is the thirteenth Spanish @ - @ language studio album by Guatemalan singer @ - @ songwriter Ricardo Arjona , released on 23 September 2011 . Recorded in the United States and Mexico , it was produced by Arjona with Dan Warner , Lee Levin and Puerto Rican singer @ - @ songwriter Tommy Torres . The album — the first independent release by Arjona after he was signed by Sony Music in 1993 and Warner Music in 2008 — was issued by his own label , Met ##am ##orf ##osis .
Comp ##osed and written in a year , the record marks Arjona and Torres ' fourth collaboration . For Independ ##iente , Arjona returns to his trademark sound after his stylistic departure for Po ##qu ##ita R ##opa ( 2010 ) . While producing the latter , he had used fewer instruments to simpl ##ify his sound , having introduced what had been called a " stripped @ - @ down acoustic effort " in his music . Independ ##iente has been compared to his earlier recordings , Histor ##ias ( 1994 ) and Animal Noct ##urn ##o ( 1993 ) .
Independ ##iente became Arjona ' s fourth number @ - @ one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums where it debuted for the week ending 22 October 2011 . For thirteen non @ - @ consecutive weeks it topped the Latin Pop Albums chart , and reached number one on the Mexican Albums Chart . It is his fifth consecutive album to chart on the Billboard 200 ( reaching number sixty @ - @ five ) , and his fourth album to chart in Spain ( peaking at number sixty @ - @ eight ) . Within one week after its release Independ ##iente was certified gold in Chile , the United States and Mexico and certified platinum in Venezuela and Argentina .
Five singles have been released from the album . The lead single , " El Amor " , became a commercial success in several Latin American countries and was number one on the Billboard Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts . It was followed by " Fu ##iste T ##ú " ( featuring Gab ##y Moreno ) , which reached number one on the Latin Pop Songs , number two on the Latin Songs charts and topped several other national charts . " Mi Nov ##ia Se Me Est ##á Pon ##iend ##o Vie ##ja " was released in May 2012 ; " Te Qu ##iero " in July 2012 , and " Si Tu No Ex ##ist ##ier ##as " in November 2012 . To promote Independ ##iente , Arjona embarked on his Met ##am ##orf ##osis World Tour .

In 2010 , Arjona wanted to change his musical style ; after experimenting with using as few instruments as possible , he obtained a sound similar to an a cap ##ella performance ( simpl ##ifying his sound ) and introduced what he called a " stripped @ - @ down acoustic effort " to his music . This was heard on his twelfth studio album , Po ##qu ##ita R ##opa . Arjona produced the album with Dan Warner , who has worked with Shakira , C ##eline Dion and Christina Aguilera . When promoting the album Arjona said , " [ songs ] are like women ; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes , more beauty . The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves , because we sat ##urate them with arrangements looking to ex ##alt their qualities and we end up hiding them " . Po ##qu ##ita R ##opa became the first album since Ad ##ent ##ro which Arjona recorded without Torres .
Weeks before the release of Independ ##iente , Arjona issued a letter raising the issue of his past relationships with recording companies . He revealed the circumstances of his first contract : " a producer , friend of mine , told them [ the record label ] that if they did not sign me in , they won ' t sign two artists he had [ at that time ] " . Arjona further explained that he received the " minimum royalty percentage " from his most successful albums . Independ ##iente is Arjona ' s first independent release through his own label : Met ##am ##orf ##osis , a company he created to ref ##ocus his career . The company is presided by Arjona and several friends ( including photographer @ - @ director Ricardo Calder ##ón , Universal Music Mé ##x ##ico executive Hum ##berto Calder ##on and BMG ' s Miriam Som ##mer ##z ) , and is based in Miami and Mexico City . Arjona commented that his independence represented compromise more than freedom , stating that " Inside the word ' Independent ' , even when it sounds like extreme freedom , there ' s a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to administ ##rate , in the best way possible , such independence " . Billboard notes that , although other groups have released independent albums following contracts with major labels , Arjona is the most important Latin pop artist to do so . Although the album is marketed within the new label , distribution was handled by Warner Music .

Independ ##iente marked Arjona ' s fourth collaboration with Torres . The latter was a composer and producer , also receiving background @ - @ vocal credit . The musicians first worked together in 2005 , when Arjona released his tenth studio album ( Ad ##ent ##ro ) . He stated that he first " tested " Torres by sending him the " hook ##iest and dark ##est tracks " on the album : " Ac ##omp ##añ ##ame A Est ##ar Solo " and " I ##lus ##o " . Torres then " went all out on the first demo , hiring a full band that included a string orchestra " . In Qu ##i ##én D ##ij ##o A ##yer ( 2007 ) , Torres produced the singles " Qu ##i ##én " and " Qu ##iero " and provided background vocals on the remastered versions of Arjona ' s past hits . In 5 ##to P ##iso ( 2008 ) , Torres produced several tracks ; one was the lead single " Como Duel ##e " , considered Arjona ' s " biggest hit in years " by Jason Birch ##meier of Allmusic .
The album was composed over a one @ - @ year period . Most of its production was handled by three producers familiar with Arjona ' s work : Dan Warner , Lee Levin and Dan Rud ##in . Tommy Torres also produced three tracks : the lead single " El Amor " , second single " Fu ##iste T ##ú " and " Hay Am ##ores " . Victor Pat ##r ##ón produced two songs , ( " C ##aud ##illo " and the piano version of " Mi Nov ##ia Se Me Est ##á Pon ##iend ##o Vie ##ja " ) and Julio Chá ##vez aided in the production of " Recon ##cil ##iac ##ión " . Arjona wrote all the songs except " El Amor " ( which was co @ - @ written with Torres ) . The album was recorded and produced in several cities in the United States and Mexico . Independ ##iente was mixed at the Blue Grot ##to in Nashville , Tennessee , and mastered by Tom C ##oyne and A ##ya Merrill at Sterling Sound in New York City . With Torres ' return to producing Arjona regained the classic , trademark sound which Torres helped develop since 2005 .
= = Composition = =
Independ ##iente opens with " Lo Que Est ##á Bien Est ##á Mal " , a Latin pop song and the only track composed by Dan Warner instead of Arjona ( who wrote the lyrics ) . " El Amor " was motivated by Arjona ' s desire to examine " those big , dark events within love that nobody talks about " ; he continued , " [ the ] dark sides of love are extremely fundamental to understand its great value . " Arjona added , " So many good things ab ##ould love has been shown that somebody had to turn it around and tell the bad ones " . In a February 2012 interview , Arjona stated that " El Amor " was the " most t ##aw ##d ##ry " song he had released to date , explaining that their choice of the song was a " contradiction " because it was not " the song which could better represent the entire album " . He described it as " very strong " and " a bit dark " . The single marked Arjona ' s return to his signature , mainstream sound after the Cuban music influenced Po ##qu ##ita R ##opa ' s lead single " Pu ##ente " , a mixture of s ##alsa and mer ##engue which failed to make an impact in the United States .
The album includes " Fu ##iste T ##ú " , a duet with Guatemalan singer Gab ##y Moreno . Its instrumentation consists of piano , violin , guitars , drums and other percussion . Although Arjona stated that he " had the possibilities to record this song with very well known people " he expressed his happiness with Moreno , revealing that " the possibilities of doing it with her , for me , are a celebration " . He described Moreno as " incredibly talented " , a " country ##woman " and a " fantastic human being " . Arjona named " Fu ##iste T ##ú " as one of the most important songs on the album . " Mi Nov ##ia Se Me Est ##á Pon ##iend ##o Vie ##ja " took two years to complete and Arjona dedicated it to his mother , No ##em ##í Morales . He stated that he wrote it " as a gift for my mom on Mother ' s Day " and that he thought " the idea of including it on the album was very good " . As with his single " Señ ##ora De Las Cu ##at ##ro Dec ##adas " ( on 1994 ' s Histor ##ias ) , at first he never thought to include the song on an album . " C ##aud ##illo " evokes " the image of some friends " Arjona had at college ; he asserted that he " appears constantly there because sometimes we transform ourselves into a contradiction of all those things we fought in those moments . It ' s the history of a student leader that becomes a president " . Arjona dedicated the album to his father , who died in 2011 .

Beginning on 27 January 2012 in Tol ##uca , Mexico , Arjona embarked on a world tour to promote the album . The Met ##am ##orf ##osis World Tour was announced in December 2011 , and visited the Americas . The show consisted of four theatrical sets on a revolving stage ; Arjona performed on each in turn , as it relate ##ed to each song . Fellow Guatemalan singer @ - @ songwriter Gab ##y Moreno appeared in several performances , joining Arjona for " Fu ##iste T ##ú " . The tour was praised by critics and fans . Natalie Torres of D ##ia a D ##ia reported , " Arjona knows how to handle his ' girls ' , with a mix of attitudes from a ' rough ' male and seductive lyrics " .
Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that " Arjona is one of Latin pop ’ s finest lyric ##ists : observ ##ant , nuanced , sometimes w ##ry , sometimes melancholy and especially fond of the play of opp ##os ##ites " . He added , " unlike some of his fellow Latin pop stars , Mr . Arjona is no sac ##char ##ine lover boy " . The tour broke records for ticket sales , commercial gross and attendance . In Buenos Aires it was the most popular show at Vel ##ez Stadium , with a total attendance of more than 160 @ , @ 000 for four consecutive sold @ - @ out concerts .

David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album a mildly positive review , citing Arjona ' s return to his more mainstream style after the " stripped @ - @ down acoustic effort " Po ##qu ##ita R ##opa . He compared ( as did Arjona and other critics ) the production values and musical style of Independ ##iente with past albums Animal Noct ##urn ##o and Histor ##ias . Finally , he stated that " Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth , and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres , the man who has been behind the boards for quite a few of Arjona ' s most popular releases " ( referring to Torres ' absence from the production of Po ##qu ##ita R ##opa ) .
A contributor to the Colombian website C ##MI commented that " listening to Independ ##iente is a lab ##yrinth to go through , each song is a huge path that seems to have no end , because it involves imagination , it invites you to dream , to charm , to be ##w ##itch . But neither leaves behind the problematic requirements of love , its lo ##oph ##oles , hide ##outs and concerns , as well as its bad times in this joke that ' s life " . Independ ##iente was nominated at the Prem ##ios Juvent ##ud of 2012 for the " Lo T ##oco Tod ##o ( I Play It All ) " award . On 25 September 2012 , the album received two nominations at the 13th Annual Latin Grammy Awards : Album of the Year and Best Singer @ - @ songwriter album . On 3 December 2012 , Independ ##iente received a nomination for " Pop Album of the Year " at the 2013 Prem ##ios Lo Nu ##estro awards .

= 2003 Pacific typhoon season =
The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly below average year ##long period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development of 31 tropical depressions , of which 21 became named storms ; of those , 14 became typh ##oons . Though every month with the exception of February and March featured tropical activity , most storms developed from May through October . During the season , tropical cyclones affected the Philippines , Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , Indochina , and various islands in the western Pacific .
The season ran year @ - @ round , with the first storm , Y ##anyan , developing west of the Marshall Islands on January 15 . In April , Typhoon Ku ##j ##ira became one of the longest @ - @ lasting Pacific typh ##oons in history and attained clim ##at ##ological records for its unusually early impacts . Typhoon I ##mb ##udo in July caused several deaths and extensive damage across the Philippines and China . In September , Typhoon Ma ##emi became one of the costliest typh ##oons in recorded history after striking South Korea ; Ma ##emi was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season with a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @ . @ 87 inHg ) . In late November , Typhoon Lup ##it devastated areas of Yap State in the Feder ##ated States of Micrones ##ia . The season closed with the dissipation of a tropical depression east of the Philippines on December 27 .
The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2003 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Tokyo Typhoon Center . Tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) have the " W " suffix added to their number . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Ge ##ophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names .

On March 5 , 2003 , meteor ##ologists from the University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk ( TSR ) Consort ##ium issued an extended range forecast for the typhoon season , noting the likelihood of near average tropical cyclone activity as a result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures . The forecast indicated the potential for 26 @ . @ 2 tropical storms , compared to the 10 – and 30 @ - @ year average of 27 @ . @ 8 and 26 @ . @ 3 storms , respectively . The following month , the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26 @ . @ 7 , indicating a slightly above average season . Over next two months , however , fluctuations in sea surface temperatures , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast . A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near @ - @ average season in their final August forecast update , which predicted 27 tropical storms . The group was very accurate in their forecasts , with their April and August forecasts being the most accurate .
Similarly , meteor ##ologists working with the City University of Hong Kong issued a seasonal projection on April 24 , 2003 , indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16 typh ##oons . As with the TSR , the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the El Niño @ - @ Southern Osc ##illation . The City University of Hong Kong revised their forecasts on June 24 , 2003 , indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to 30 . The group was also accurate in their forecasts for the entirety of the Northwest Pacific , though their specialized forecasts for the South China Sea were substantially off .
During the year , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula , and north of the equator ; this was due to the agency ' s status as the official Regional Special ##ized Meteorological Center , as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989 . The JMA issued forecasts and analyses four times a day , beginning at 0000 UTC and continuing every six hours . The JMA issued forecasts based on a clim ##at ##ological tropical cyclone forecast model . The agency estimated 10 minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction . The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin , operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the interests of the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans .
= = Season summary = =
Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial Pacific were above normal , including those in the South China Sea . Areas of convection persisted year @ - @ round in the lower latitudes , particularly around the Philippines . Atmospheric divergence was also prevalent in the same regions , resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 – 2000 30 @ - @ year average . In 2003 , the JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity ; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the ratio between tropical storms and typh ##oons was 66 % greater than normal . The Philippine Atmospheric , Ge ##ophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA .
The season began with the formation of Tropical Storm Y ##anyan on January 15 . After its dissipation five days later , no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months . This period of inactivity ended with the formation of Typhoon Ku ##j ##ira in mid @ - @ April ; Ku ##j ##ira was one of the longest lived Pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with 1 @ - @ minute sustained winds of at least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) in April since Typhoon Isa in 1997 . Tropical activity was enhanced from May to June , and during this period the JMA monitored four tropical storms , while the PAGASA monitored a fifth storm off the eastern Philippines . Three of the four tropical storms monitored by the JMA approached or hit Japan , including Typhoon Soud ##el ##or , which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the Ry ##uk ##yu Islands and the Korean Peninsula .
Tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of June and first half of July . The second half of July , however , featured the development of typh ##oons I ##mb ##udo and Kon ##i , which both tracked westward across the Philippines before striking areas near Saipan and other regions of southeastern China . I ##mb ##udo caused the deaths of 78 people and US $ 383 million in damage . August was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis , with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the JMA , JTWC , and PAGASA . This included typh ##oons K ##rov ##an ##h and Du ##j ##uan , which also struck southeastern China . Typhoon Et ##au earlier in the month made landfall in Japan , resulting in 17 deaths .
Act ##ivity was somewhat below average in September , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall , Ma ##emi . However , Ma ##emi was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly US $ 4 @ . @ 8 billion in damage , mostly in South Korea . Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after August , with October featuring only three tropical storms . However , two , K ##ets ##ana and Parma , reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land . November featured less storms but was clim ##at ##ologically average , with two typh ##oons developing . The second typhoon , Lup ##it , devastated portions of Yap State , resulting in approximately $ 1 @ . @ 7 million in damage . In December , the JTWC and PAGASA monitored a sole tropical system east of the Philippines , though the JMA did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month .
= = Storms = =
In storm information below , wind @ - @ speed advisories differ from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) to the JMA as the JTWC uses the United States criteria of 1 @ - @ minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds , while the JMA uses the 10 @ - @ minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds . This difference generally results in JTWC maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the JMA for the same cyclone .
= = = Tropical Storm Y ##anyan = = =
On January 11 , the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop into Y ##anyan near the International Date Line . As the system tracked westward , it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . On January 14 , surface observations indicated that the low @ - @ pressure area had developed a closed , low @ - @ level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone , satellite imagery remained inconclusive . Nonetheless , the JMA classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Islands at 0600 UTC on January 15 . The JTWC would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 UTC later that day . At the time , the depression was tracking west @ - @ northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north . Over the next day the system waned in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remained nam ##eless as the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical depression .
Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again oscill ##ate in strength , resulting in a brief down ##grade by the JTWC to tropical depression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in its reclass ##ification as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name Y ##anyan . At roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply northeastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated that Y ##anyan peaked in strength late on January 18 with 1 @ - @ minute sustained winds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , the JMA considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm . Ste ##ered by the same nearby subtropical ridge , Y ##anyan would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . The JMA downgraded Y ##anyan to tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @ - @ level circulation center dec ##ou ##pled from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear . At 0000 UTC , both the JTWC and JMA discontinued the monitoring of Y ##anyan .
= = = Typhoon Ku ##j ##ira ( Am ##ang ) = = =
Ku ##j ##ira developed from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April 9 well removed from any land ##m ##asses . Shortly after development , Ku ##j ##ira quickly intensified in its early stages , and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis . Str ##engthening slowed afterwards , though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April 14 . Int ##ens ##ification continued and late on April 15 , Ku ##j ##ira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @ . @ 46 inHg ) . Following peak intensity , Ku ##j ##ira would begin to track northwest and oscill ##ate in strength , crest ##ing an additional two times in intensity . On April 21 , the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track err ##atically for several days east of Taiwan . However , on April 24 , Ku ##j ##ira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken , and on April 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Ky ##ushu . Following landfall , Ku ##j ##ira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on April 25 , which persisted until crossing the International Dat ##eline towards the end of April 2003 .
Shortly after developing , Ku ##j ##ira caused two fatalities in Po ##hn ##pe ##i in addition to minor agricultural and infr ##ast ##ruct ##ural damage ; similar effects were felt in Guam . Several days later , the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and other precaution ##ary measures in the Philippines after forecasts indicated the potential for strong winds and rain . However , ultimately any effects in the archipelago associated with Ku ##j ##ira remained minimal . The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan , making it the first April typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat . Unlike in the Philippines , however , Ku ##j ##ira would bring significant rainfall to Taiwan . Effects from the typhoon were most significant in Japan , particularly in the Ry ##uk ##yu Islands . Strong winds , rain , and waves caused US $ 230 @ , @ 000 ( ¥ 27 @ . @ 8 million ) in agricultural damage on Ish ##ig ##aki Island . One person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves . In Ky ##ushu , heavy rainfall , peaking at 196 mm ( 7 @ . @ 7 in ) in Ō ##ita Prefecture , was reported . Overall , despite its distance away from land and weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall , Ku ##j ##ira resulted in three fatalities .
= = = Typhoon Chan @ - @ hom = = =
Midd ##ay on May 18 , the JTWC began to monitor an area of persistent disturbed weather associated with a broad low @ - @ pressure area southwest of Chu ##uk . Within highly conduct ##ive conditions , the disturbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC the following day . In its initial stages , the depression tracked slowly northeast ##wards . However , a short ##wave trough forced a weakness in a nearby ridge , allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined , northward path . At 1200 UTC on May 20 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chan @ - @ hom . Following the system ' s naming , Chan @ - @ hom temporarily me ##andered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track . The next day , the storm began to develop an eye ; this was reflected with an upgrade by the JMA to typhoon status at 0600 UTC on May 23 . Grad ##ual intensification followed , and at 1800 UTC that day Chan @ - @ hom reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 940 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @ . @ 76 inHg ) .
Following peak intensity , Chan @ - @ hom began to intake dry air beginning on May 25 . At roughly the same time , the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast . Conditions continued to wors ##en as the storm moved further north , and as the cyclone passed east of Min ##am ##itor ##ishima , it was downgraded to tropical storm classification . By this time , Chan @ - @ hom had lost much of its convection due to wind shear . Early on May 27 , Chan @ - @ hom had fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and these remnants continued to track towards the northeast . These extratropical remnants dissipated south of the Aleutian Islands the following day . Early in the typhoon ' s existence , Chan @ - @ hom posed a potential threat to Guam , but remained well east of the island . However , after passing to the northeast , winds from the typhoon f ##anned volcanic ash from the recently erupt ##ing Anat ##ahan volcano towards the island , prompting precaution ##ary measures in Guam . Ash ##falls were reported on the island , forcing the cancellation of several flights . As a tropical storm , Chan @ - @ hom caused some damage to homes and crops on Chu ##uk , mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm . Offshore , a 1 @ , @ 04 ##0 ton fishing vessel , the N ##ien Fe ##io ##ch , sank during the storm . The ship was valued at $ 16 million .
= = = Severe Tropical Storm Lin ##fa ( Ched ##eng ) = = =
Tropical Storm Lin ##fa developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May 25 . The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis . However , intensification leveled off as Lin ##fa executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May 27 . Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and dec ##ou ##pled before reforming in the Philippine Sea . Afterwards Lin ##fa began reint ##ens ##ifying and reached its peak intensity on May 29 with maximum sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @ . @ 94 inHg ) . Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May 30 ; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of Ok ##h ##ots ##k on June 4 .
The erratic and slow movement of Lin ##fa off the western Philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding , killing 41 persons in the archipelago . Precipitation peaked at 72 ##3 mm ( 28 @ . @ 5 in ) near Dag ##up ##an . Rising floodwaters resulted in the temporary shutdown of government offices and numerous mudslides . In addition , strong winds caused widespread power outages . Overall damage from Lin ##fa in the Philippines amounted to ₱ 192 @ . @ 3 million ( US $ 3 @ . @ 65 million ) . The floods also displaced 8 @ , @ 367 people in 1 @ , @ 68 ##6 families and destroyed 178 homes . Lin ##fa and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to Japan , particularly in southwestern regions . Rainfall there peaked at 727 mm ( 28 @ . @ 62 in ) . Flood damage was worst in Kō ##chi and Tok ##ushima Pre ##fect ##ures , where several buildings were destroyed by flood ##water . Other locations in Japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides . Overall , Lin ##fa caused roughly $ 28 @ . @ 2 million in damage , much of which occurred in Japan , though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the Philippines .
= = = Severe Tropical Storm Nang ##ka ( Dod ##ong ) = = =
In late May , an area of disturbed weather began to persist in the South China Sea . The JTWC began to monitor the storm cluster on May 29 . The following day , the JMA reclassified the system as a tropical depression ; initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack of deep convection . Pers ##istent moderate wind shear and dry air prevented the cyclone from strengthening significantly in the storm ' s early stages . These conditions ab ##ated as the depression tracked northeast , and at 0000 UTC on June 1 , the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Nang ##ka . Throughout the course of the day , Nang ##ka continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast , and peaked in strength with a barometric pressure of 98 ##5 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @ . @ 09 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm .
However , upon moving through the B ##ashi Channel , conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear , weakening the system and resulting in its down ##grade to tropical depression status by the JMA at 1200 UTC on June 3 . Nang ##ka continued to become increasingly disorganized as it moved further north , and late that day , the depression transitioned to an extratropical cyclone . The resulting remnants continued to track well east of Japan before dissipating on June 7 . Due to its track away from land ##m ##asses , damage remained minimal ; however , as Nang ##ka passed to the south and east of Japan , the storm brought light rainfall to the country , peaking at 81 mm ( 3 @ . @ 2 in ) in Min ##am ##ida ##it ##ō , Okinawa .
= = = Typhoon Soud ##el ##or ( Eg ##ay ) = = =
A tropical disturbance persisted in the monsoon trough northwest of Po ##hn ##pe ##i on June 7 , and moved westward without development due to wind shear . On June 11 , the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize , and the next day the JMA classified it as a tropical depression northeast of Palau . On June 13 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Soud ##el ##or to the east of the Philippines , and PAGASA gave it the local name " Eg ##ay " . Soud ##el ##or moved to the northwest and later to the north , parallel to the eastern Philippines , and on June 17 , the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status . The storm rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan as it developed a well @ - @ defined eye , and while doing so passed over the Japanese island of I ##ri ##om ##ote @ - @ j ##ima at around 20 ##30 UTC on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , while the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen on June 19 , and later that day the JMA declared the storm as extratropical near the O ##ki Islands . The extratropical remnants of Soud ##el ##or continued to the northeast , crossing northern Japan on June 20 and dissipating on June 24 .
While offshore the Philippines , Soud ##el ##or dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless . The storm caused ₱ 131 million ( PHP , $ 2 @ . @ 46 million USD ) in damage and 12 deaths . On the Japanese island of I ##ri ##om ##ote @ - @ j ##ima , where wind gusts reached 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) . It also affected Taiwan , where floods covered highways and caused mudslides . In Japan , the storm caused widespread power outages , although damage was minimal , and there were 21 injuries . In South Korea , there was $ 12 @ . @ 1 million in damage and two deaths .
= = = Typhoon I ##mb ##udo ( Har ##u ##rot ) = = =
On July 15 , the JMA estimated that a tropical depression formed , and the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09 ##W about 66 ##5 km ( 415 mi ) east of Yap . A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west @ - @ northwest for much of its duration . With warm waters and favorable upper @ - @ level conditions , the depression quickly organized , first to Tropical Storm I ##mb ##udo on July 17 , and to typhoon status two days later , when PAGASA begin issuing advisories on Typhoon Har ##u ##rot . Around that time , I ##mb ##udo was rapidly intensifying , developing a well @ - @ defined eye . At 1200 UTC on July 20 , the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , and the same time , the JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , making it a super typhoon . I ##mb ##udo maintained peak winds for about 12 hours , before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle . At 03 ##00 UTC on July 22 , I ##mb ##udo struck northern Luzon , with 1 minute winds estimated at 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) by the JTWC . It weakened over land , but re @ - @ intensified in the South China Sea , striking southern China near Yang ##jiang , Guangdong on July 24 . I ##mb ##udo rapidly weakened , dissipating on July 25 .
In the Philippines , officials evacuated over 14 @ , @ 000 people . I ##mb ##udo was the strongest typhoon to strike since Typhoon Zeb five years prior , The typhoon left widespread areas flooded for several days . Damage was heaviest in the Cag ##ayan Valley , where over 80 @ , @ 000 people were displaced by the storm . In Isab ##ela , high winds wrecked most of the banana crop and severely damaged other crops . Throughout the Philippines , I ##mb ##udo damaged or destroyed 62 @ , @ 314 houses , causing P ##4 . 7 billion ( 2003 PHP , $ 86 million 2003 USD ) in damage . There were 64 deaths in the country .

= = = Severe Tropical Storm Kon ##i ( Gil ##as ) = = =
Kon ##i originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines on July 15 . Tracking westward , intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17 . Upon moving into the South China Sea , conditions allowed for quicker strengthening , and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . However , atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Kon ##i made landfall on Hain ##an on July 21 , weakening the system . The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Ton ##kin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi , Vietnam the following day . Tracking inland , the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Kon ##i to dissipate over Laos on July 23 .
Shortly after development , Kon ##i tracked through the Philippines , killing two people . After moving into the South China Sea , turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines . Three of the plane ' s occupants received minor injuries . In Hain ##an , Kon ##i caused heavy rainfall , peaking at 189 mm ( 7 @ . @ 44 in ) at a station on W ##uz ##hi Mountain . The rains resulted in the collapse of 1 @ , @ 400 homes and an estimated CN ¥ 140 @ . @ 27 million ( US $ 16 @ . @ 9 million ) in direct economic losses . Effects were worst in Vietnam , where three people were killed .

= = = Tropical Storm Mor ##ak ##ot ( Juan ##ing ) = = =
Mor ##ak ##ot spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July 31 . Tracking northwest , favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on August 2 . Mor ##ak ##ot reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 99 ##2 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @ . @ 29 inHg ) . This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system ; this was followed by Mor ##ak ##ot making landfall on southern Taiwan on August 3 . Subsequently , the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near Qu ##anz ##hou , China the next day . The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland , and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall .
In Taiwan , where Mor ##ak ##ot first made landfall , heavy rainfall resulted in flooding . Commercial flights , schools , and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm . Precipitation there peaked at 65 ##3 mm ( 25 @ . @ 71 in ) over a period of nearly two days in T ##ait ##ung County . C ##rop damage also resulted from the rainfall , and was estimated at over NT $ 70 million ( US $ 2 million ) . In China , record rainfall was reported . The worst impacted city was Qu ##anz ##hou , where losses due to Mor ##ak ##ot reached CN ¥ 240 million ( US $ 29 million ) and one death was reported . Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China . Due to p ##ree ##x ##isting drought conditions , 70 ##3 cloud seed ##ing operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall ; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area . Overall , Mor ##ak ##ot caused roughly $ 31 million in damage and three deaths .
= = = Typhoon Et ##au ( Kab ##ayan ) = = =
A tropical depression developed on August 2 southeast of Guam , and gradually intensified while moving to the northwest , becoming a tropical storm on August 3 and a typhoon a day later . Et ##au formed an eye and became a large storm by the time it approached Okinawa on August 7 . The typhoon attained peak winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) before weakening slightly while turning to the northeast . Et ##au made landfall on the Japanese island of Shik ##oku on August 8 , and later moved across portions of Hons ##hu and Hokkaid ##o . After weakening to tropical storm status , the cyclone became extratropical on August 9 and dissipated three days later .
While passing northeast of the Philippines , the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago . The eye crossed over Okinawa , where Et ##au left 166 @ , @ 800 people without power and caused 10 injuries . Near where Et ##au first struck Japan , Mu ##ro ##to reported a peak wind gust of 166 km / h ( 103 mph ) , at the time the third strongest on record there . The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 68 ##3 mm ( 26 @ . @ 9 in ) . The combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides , particularly on Hokkaid ##o .

= = = Typhoon K ##rov ##an ##h ( Ni ##ña ) = = =
K ##rov ##an ##h originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough east of Chu ##uk State on August 13 . Despite rather favorable conditions , the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18 . However , these remnants were able to reorgan ##ize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later . Int ##ens ##ification was rather rapid upon the storm ' s reform ##ation – the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later . Shortly after , K ##rov ##an ##h made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm , though it was able to restr ##engthen over warm waters . Once again at typhoon intensity , K ##rov ##an ##h cl ##ipped Hain ##an before moving over the Le ##iz ##hou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near C ##ẩ ##m Ph ##ả , Vietnam on August 25 . Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as K ##rov ##an ##h moved across northern Vietnam , where the storm met its demise the following day .
K ##rov ##an ##h first struck the Philippines , resulting in heavy rainfall and displ ##acing approximately 1 @ , @ 000 families . The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person . K ##rov ##an ##h ' s effects were much more severe in China . In Hong Kong , eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon ' s outer rainbands . However , Guangdong Province , Hain ##an Province , and Guang ##xi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted . The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guang ##xi . In those three regions combined , 13 @ , @ 000 homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large sw ##ath of farmland was damaged . Two people were killed in China and economic losses approx ##imated to ¥ 2 @ . @ 1 billion ( US $ 253 million ) .

Overall , the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons .
= = = Tropical Storm V ##am ##co ( Man ##ang ) = = =
The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of August , one of which became Tropical Depression Lak ##ay near the Philippines . On August 18 , an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation , developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon . It moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening , such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction . On August 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm V ##am ##co to the east of Taiwan . Later that day , the circulation passed just 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of Ta ##ipe ##i , although the convection was exposed that time . On August 20 , the JMA assessed V ##am ##co as dissipating in the Taiwan Strait , although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China .
Rainfall in Taiwan reached 69 mm ( 2 @ . @ 7 in ) in I ##lan County . On the island , the storm left several hundred houses without power due to a lightning strike . On mainland China , rainfall peaked at 101 mm ( 4 @ . @ 0 in ) in W ##enz ##hou , Z ##he ##jiang , which were largely beneficial in e ##asing drought conditions , while winds g ##usted to 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) .

The storm quickly intensified into a typhoon , after developing an eye in the center . On September 1 , the JMA estimated Du ##j ##uan attained peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , and the JTWC assessed peak 1 – minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . While near peak intensity , the center of Du ##j ##uan passed about 45 km ( 30 mi ) south of the southern tip of Taiwan . The typhoon weakened steadily and was a severe tropical storm by the time it made landfall on September 2 just east of Hong Kong . The JTWC estimated landfall winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , making it the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979 . Du ##j ##uan rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China , dissipating on September 3 over Guang ##xi .
In the Philippines , Du ##j ##uan interacted with the monsoon to produce heavy rainfall , killing one person .

There were initially several circ ##ulations , with a tropical upper trop ##ospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow . After slowing and turning to the northeast , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kopp ##u on September 26 . After the storm developed a large eye feature , the JTWC upgraded it to typhoon status on September 27 , although the JMA did not follow suit until the following day while near Ch ##ichi @ - @ j ##ima . Also that day , Kopp ##u passed 95 km ( 60 mi ) west of Iwo Jima , and the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northeastward . The convection diminished near the center , causing Kopp ##u to become extratropical on September 30 . The remnants continued generally northeastward through the Aleutian Islands , eventually passing south of mainland Alaska on October 7 .
On Ch ##ichi @ - @ j ##ima , Typhoon Kopp ##u produced sustained winds of 102 km / h ( 63 mph ) , with gusts to 200 km / h ( 124 mph ) , which was the third strongest on record for the station .

In the middle of October , an area of convection persisted along the monsoon trough between Luzon and Guam , developing into a tropical depression on October 17 . The same monsoon trough later spawned Typhoon Parma to the east . For several days , the system remained disorganized while drifting to the west @ - @ northwest due to weak steering currents south of the subtropical ridge . On October 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm K ##ets ##ana , and by that time the storm had begun drifting to the northeast . With favorable outflow , K ##ets ##ana quickly intensified into a typhoon on October 20 after developing an eye , and two days later , the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) around the time the well @ - @ defined eye had expanded to 37 km ( 23 mi ) . Subsequently , the typhoon accelerated northeastward into the w ##ester ##lies and began weakening due to increasing wind shear and dry air . On October 26 , K ##ets ##ana became extratropical to the east of Japan and dissipated the next day . The passage of the typhoon caused surface chlor ##ophyll a concentration in the ocean to increase 30 @ - @ fold .

The same monsoon trough that spawned Typhoon Kopp ##u also produced an area of convection to the north @ - @ northeast of Guam , becoming a tropical depression on October 19 . The system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge . With low wind shear and favorable outflow , the convection became better organized , and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Parma on October 21 . After an eye began to form , Parma was upgraded to typhoon status the next day . An approaching trough caused Parma to accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow . On October 24 , the JMA estimated peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while the JTWC estimated winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , an unusually high intensity for 30 ° N . Subsequently , Parma rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the east @ - @ southeast , beginning a nearly week @ - @ long loop . The cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward .
Increasing wind shear weakened the convection , and Parma deteriorated into a severe tropical storm on October 26 . The next day , it began moving westward while passing about 345 km ( 215 mi ) north of Wake Island . A large eye of 110 km ( 70 mi ) in diameter developed , and on October 28 , the JMA re @ - @ upgraded Parma to typhoon status . The next day , the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough . With decreasing wind shear and warmer waters , Parma re @ - @ intensified significantly on October 29 , reaching a secondary peak of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) according to JMA , and 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) according to JTWC . The storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior . Increasing wind shear on October 30 caused rapid weakening , resulting in the eye dissipating . By the next day , the center was exposed , and Parma became extratropical , later exiting the basin on November 1 . The remnants weakened , later turning to the southeast and dissipating on November 11 southwest of California .

Late in October , an area of convection persisted northwest of Palau and quickly organized into a tropical depression on October 29 . Moving west @ - @ northwestward toward the Philippines due to a ridge to the east , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Mel ##or on October 30 . With minimal wind shear , the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye . The JTWC upgraded Mel ##or to typhoon status on October 31 , estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) , although the JMA estimated the storm only attained peak 10 minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Early on November 1 , Mel ##or made landfall on northeastern Luzon in the Philippines , south of Pal ##anan . The storm weakened over land and emerged into the South China Sea . By that time , it was moving northward along the periphery of the ridge to the east . On November 2 , Mel ##or turned to the northeast , passing just east of Taiwan . The next day , it weakened to tropical depression status , and after me ##andering offshore eastern Taiwan , Mel ##or continued northeastward . It became extratropical on November 5 and dissipated the next day near southern Japan .
In the Philippines , Mel ##or dropped about 150 mm ( 6 in ) of rainfall , which flooded the Cag ##ayan River and killed four people . In Taiwan , rainfall reached 55 ##4 mm ( 21 @ . @ 8 in ) in Ping ##t ##ung County . On the Japanese island of H ##ater ##uma , rainfall totaled 197 mm ( 7 @ . @ 8 in ) , which broke the hourly and daily record for the station in November .

A tropical depression developed near Yap on November 11 . The system intensified gradually as it tracked quickly westward toward the Philippines . An anticyclone aloft allowed for strengthening , and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Nep ##art ##ak on November 12 . Simultaneously , the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric , Ge ##ophysical and Astronomical Services Administration , which named it Tropical Storm W ##eng . At around 1600 UTC on November 13 , Nep ##art ##ak made landfall on northern Samar Island in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west . The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea weakened but quickly re @ - @ intensified while continuing to the west @ - @ northwest . The JTWC estimated peak winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) on November 16 , and later that day , the JMA upgraded the storm to typhoon status , estimating peak 10 @ - @ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . On November 18 , Nep ##art ##ak passed near southwestern Hain ##an and weakened , with the convection diminishing from the circulation . By the next day , the system weakened to tropical depression status , and dissipated shortly after moving ashore over Be ##ih ##ai , China .
In the Philippines , Nep ##art ##ak produced strong winds , heavy rainfall , and rough seas . The storm caused widespread power outages and ferry disrupt ##ions . According to the PAGASA in its post @ - @ storm report , a total of 13 people lost their lives during the storm . On Hain ##an , the storm helped end one of the worst summer d ##rough ##ts in almost 65 years , although it also left heavy crop damage , wreck ##ing 64 @ , @ 000 ha ( 160 @ , @ 000 acres ) of fields and killing 400 head of livestock .

Typhoon Lup ##it formed on November 18 from the monsoon trough to the west of the Marshall Islands . Early in its duration , it moved generally to the west or west @ - @ southwest . On November 21 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lup ##it , and two days later , it strengthened into a typhoon , developing an eye . Lup ##it later began a prolonged movement to the northwest , during which it passed near several islands in Yap State . The typhoon reached peak intensity on November 26 , with peak 10 – minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . It later weakened due to a variety of unfavorable conditions , and after recur ##ving to the northeast , Lup ##it became extratropical south of Japan on December 2 .
Typhoon Lup ##it first affected Po ##hn ##pe ##i with gusty winds , and later it damaged or destroyed about 200 homes in Chu ##uk State . There , high waves flooded roads and homes , while high winds damaged crops . Damage was heaviest in Yap State , mostly in the small Ul ##ith ##i at ##oll and Fais Island . On both islands , the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked the crops . Rainfall reached 263 mm ( 10 @ . @ 35 in ) on Ul ##ith ##i , and gusts reached 158 km / h ( 98 mph ) . Throughout the FS ##M , damage totaled about $ 1 @ . @ 7 million , although there were no deaths . The damage prompted the FS ##M government to declare two states as disaster areas , as well as a disaster declaration from the United States federal government . While Lup ##it was becoming extratropical , it became the first typhoon in December to threaten Japan in 13 years . The storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight canc ##ellations .

An area of convection formed on May 16 to the southwest of Palau , located within an area of weak wind shear . The next day , the JMA and the JTWC both classified the system as a tropical depression . The convection was disorganized in association with multiple circulation centers , although it gradually organized . Moving westward initially , the depression turned more to the north into an area of increasing wind shear . On May 19 , the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm 03 ##W , and on the same day , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Depression Bat ##ib ##ot . Soon after , the convection decreased from the center , and by May 20 , all warning agencies had discontinued advisories .
On July 9 , PAGASA classified a system as Tropical Depression Falcon , off the west coast of the Philippines . The JMA also briefly initiated advisories before dropping them later on July 9 . Later in the month , PAGASA briefly issued advisories on Tropical Depression In ##eng on July 30 off the east coast of Mind ##anao . The depression dissipated the next day , causing about P ##8 million ( PHP , $ 145 @ , @ 000 USD ) in damage . The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north of Luzon on August 18 , with PAGASA naming it Lak ##ay . There were several circ ##ulations in the region , with Tropical Storm V ##am ##co to the northeast near Taiwan , and the overall system moved generally westward . PAGASA briefly classified Lak ##ay as a tropical storm on August 19 before ending advisories the next day . The system spread rainfall across China , reaching 82 @ . @ 4 mm ( 3 @ . @ 24 in ) in X ##iamen , Fuj ##uan .
On September 5 , former Hurricane Jim ##ena crossed the International Date Line into the basin . By that time , the circulation was largely exposed from the convection , and the center quickly dissipated . Later in the month , the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east of the Philippines that PAGASA classified as Tropical Depression Qu ##iel on September 15 . The system moved westward but never intensified , dissipating west of Luzon on September 19 . The broad system also spawned Typhoon Ch ##oi @ - @ wan .
In October , the JTWC classified Tropical Depression 18 ##W early in the month off the west coast of Luzon . With weak steering currents , the system moved slowly southwestward before loop ##ing to the northwest . On October 10 , the depression dissipated just off the coast of southern China . On October 5 , the JMA monitored a tropical depression southeast of Taiwan that later passed near the island , producing heavy rainfall that peaked at 153 mm ( 6 @ . @ 0 in ) in I ##lan County . A few days later , the JTWC monitored Tropical Depression 19 ##W , which developed on October 12 after an extratropical storm produced an area of convection . Described as a subtropical low , the depression moved generally northeastward toward Japan due to an approaching cold front . The depression moved through Ky ##ushu and Hons ##hu before dissipating on October 13 . The depression dropped 285 mm ( 11 @ . @ 2 in ) of rainfall in Kō ##chi , while strong winds associated reached 217 km / h ( 135 mph ) through a storm @ - @ produced down ##burst . The winds knocked over two cranes , killing two people , and left about 9 @ , @ 000 homes without power . The depression also killed two people due to drown ##ings . On October 16 , the JMA briefly classified a tropical depression to the east of the Marian ##as Islands . On October 22 , a tropical depression developed in the South China Sea , classified by PAGASA as Ursula . The system moved eastward and crossed Pal ##awan before dissipating on October 24 . In the Philippines , the depression killed one person and caused minor damage . Also in October , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression in the Gulf of Thailand , which moved northwestward and crossed into the Indian Ocean , dropping heavy rainfall in Thailand .
In mid @ - @ November , the JMA briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near Wake Island . The agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast of Vietnam on December 16 . It finally dissipated on December 17 , with the pressure and winds unknown . The final system of the year was a tropical depression that originated out of the monsoon trough on December 24 east of the Philippines . After initially moving to the west , it turned to the south , and the JTWC estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm . During this time , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm Z ##ig ##z ##ag . The system made landfall in northeastern Mind ##anao and dissipated on December 27 , bringing heavy rainfall .

= Ox ##azir ##id ##ine =
An ox ##azir ##id ##ine is an organic molecule that features a three @ - @ member ##ed heter ##ocy ##cle containing oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon . In their largest application , ox ##az ##id ##ines are intermedi ##ates in the industrial production of hyd ##raz ##ine . Ox ##azir ##id ##ine derivatives are also used as specialized reag ##ents in organic chemistry for a variety of oxid ##ations , including alpha hydrox ##yl ##ation of en ##ol ##ates , ep ##ox ##idation and az ##ir ##id ##ination of o ##le ##f ##ins , and other heter ##oat ##om transfer reactions . Ox ##azir ##id ##ines also serve as precursors to am ##ides and participate in [ 3 + 2 ] cycl ##oad ##d ##itions with various heter ##oc ##um ##ul ##enes to form substituted five @ - @ member ##ed heter ##ocy ##cles . Ch ##iral ox ##azir ##id ##ine derivatives effect asymmet ##ric oxygen transfer to pro ##ch ##iral en ##ol ##ates as well as other subst ##rates . Some ox ##azir ##id ##ines also have the property of a high barrier to inversion of the nitrogen , allowing for the possibility of ch ##iral ##ity at the nitrogen center .
= = History = =
Ox ##azir ##id ##ine derivatives were first reported in the mid @ - @ 1950s by Em ##mons and subsequently by Kr ##imm and Horner and J ##ür ##g ##ens . Whereas oxygen and nitrogen typically act as nucle ##oph ##iles due to their high elect ##rone ##g ##ativity , ox ##azir ##id ##ines allow for elect ##roph ##ilic transfer of both heter ##oat ##oms . This unusual react ##ivity is due to the presence of the highly strained three member ##ed ring and the relatively weak N @ - @ O bond . N ##ucle ##oph ##iles tend to attack at the az ##ir ##id ##ine nitrogen when the nitrogen substit ##u ##ent is small ( R ##1 = H ) , and at the oxygen atom when the nitrogen substit ##u ##ent has greater ster ##ic bulk . The unusual electronics of the ox ##azir ##id ##ine system may be exploited to perform a number of oxygen and nitrogen transfer reactions including , but not limited to : α @ - @ hydrox ##yl ##ation of en ##ol ##ates , ep ##ox ##idation of alk ##enes , selective oxidation of sulf ##ides and sel ##en ##ides , am ##ination of N @ - @ nucle ##oph ##iles and N @ - @ ac ##yl ##am ##idation .
The Per ##oxide process for the industrial production of hyd ##raz ##ine through the oxidation of ammonia with hydrogen per ##oxide in the presence of ket ##ones was developed in the early 1970s .
Ch ##iral camp ##hors ##ulf ##ony ##l ##ox ##azir ##id ##ines proved useful in the synthes ##es of complex natural product , such as tax ##ol which is marketed as a chemotherapy agent .

Additionally , oxidation of ch ##iral im ##ines and oxidation of im ##ines with ch ##iral per ##ac ##ids may yield en ##ant ##iop ##ure ox ##azir ##id ##ines . Some ox ##azir ##id ##ines have the unique property of configuration ##ally stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an inversion barrier of 24 to 31 k ##cal / mol .

α @ - @ Hydro ##x ##yk ##et ##ones , or ac ##yl ##oin ##s , are an important synthetic motifs present in many natural products . α @ - @ Hydro ##x ##yk ##et ##ones have been synthesized in many ways , including reduction of α @ - @ d ##ik ##et ##ones , substitution of a hydrox ##yl for a leaving group and direct oxidation of an en ##olate . Ox ##od ##iper ##ox ##ym ##oly ##b ##den ##um ( p ##yr ##id ##ine ) - ( hex ##am ##et ##hyl ##ph ##osph ##oric tri ##am ##ide ) ( Mo ##OP ##H ) and N @ - @ sulf ##ony ##l ##ox ##azir ##id ##ines are the most common elect ##roph ##ilic sources of oxygen implemented in this process . One advantage of using N @ - @ sulf ##ony ##l ##ox ##azir ##id ##ines is that higher ch ##iral induction is almost invariably observed relative to Mo ##OP ##H and other oxid ##ants . High yield ( 77 @ - @ 91 % ) and dr ( 95 : 5 - 99 : 1 ) are reported for α @ - @ hydrox ##yl ##ation with the Evans ' ch ##iral auxiliary with N @ - @ sulf ##ony ##l ##ox ##azir ##id ##ine as the elect ##roph ##ile . Ch ##iral induction has been demonstrated with many other ch ##iral ket ##ones and ket ##ones with ch ##iral a ##uxili ##aries , including SA ##MP and RAM ##P .
Extensive work has been reported on asymmet ##ric hydrox ##yl ##ation of pro ##ch ##iral en ##ol ##ates with camp ##hors ##ulf ##ony ##l ##ox ##azir ##id ##ine derivatives , achieving moderate to high en ##anti ##omer ##ic excess . The commonly accepted proposed transition state that just ##ifies this stere ##ochem ##ical outcome involves an open transition state where the ster ##ic bulk of R ##1 determines the face of approach .
The select ##ivity of some hydrox ##yl ##ations may be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the ox ##azir ##id ##ine ring as ox ##azir ##id ##ines 3 ##b and 3 ##c in the table above . In these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal ox ##yan ##ion is stabilized by chel ##ation from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camp ##hor skeleton .
α @ - @ Hydro ##x ##yl ##ation with ox ##azir ##id ##ines has been widely implemented in total synthesis .

Ep ##ox ##idation of alk ##enes is a common reaction because ep ##ox ##ides can be deriv ##at ##ized in a number of useful ways .

Ox ##azir ##id ##ines have been found to be useful for the formation of highly acid sensitive ep ##ox ##ides . ( − ) - Cha ##et ##omin ##ine was synthesized via ox ##azir ##id ##ine ep ##ox ##idation as a late stage transformation as seen below .
Another transformation of high synthetic utility is asymmet ##ric ep ##ox ##idation . A number of asymmet ##ric ep ##ox ##id ##ations exist : the Shar ##pless ep ##ox ##idation , the Jacob ##sen @ - @ Kats ##uki ep ##ox ##idation , and the Jul ##i ##á @ - @ Col ##onna Ep ##ox ##idation . These methods require specific functionality in order to achieve select ##ivity . The Shar ##pless ep ##ox ##idation is specific to ally ##lic alco ##h ##ols , the Jacob ##sen ep ##ox ##idation requires c ##is @ - @ dis ##ub ##stituted ar ##yl alk ##enes , and the Jul ##i ##á ep ##ox ##idation requires α @ - @ β uns ##at ##urated ket ##ones .

In light of this effect , it is possible to take advantage of the ch ##iral nitrogen due to high inversion barrier to direct the rearr ##ang ##ement . This phenomenon is demonstrated by observed select ##ivities in the rearr ##ang ##ements below . In the rearr ##ang ##ement on the left the therm ##ody ##nam ##ically unfavorable product is observed exclusively , while in the reaction on the right the product derived from the less stable radical intermediate is favored .

Dü ##ren ##stein ( modern Dür ##n ##stein ) is located in the W ##ach ##au Valley , on the River Danube , 73 kilometers ( 45 mi ) upstream from Vienna , Austria . The river makes a crescent @ - @ shaped curve between Dür ##n ##stein and nearby Krem ##s an der Don ##au and the battle was fought in the flood plain between the river and the mountains .
At Dü ##ren ##stein a combined force of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by Thé ##odore Max ##ime Gaz ##an . The French division was part of the newly created VIII Corps , the so @ - @ called Corps Mort ##ier , under command of Éd ##ouard Mort ##ier . In pursuing the Austrian retreat from Bavaria , Mort ##ier had over @ - @ extended his three divisions along the north bank of the Danube . Mikhail Ill ##ar ##ion ##ovich Kut ##uz ##ov , commander of the Coalition force , ent ##iced Mort ##ier to send Gaz ##an ' s division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns . They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division , under command of Pierre Dup ##ont de l ' É ##t ##ang . The battle extended well into the night . Both sides claimed victory . The French lost more than a third of their participants , and Gaz ##an ' s division experienced over 40 percent losses . The Austrians and Russians also had heavy losses - - close to 16 percent - - but perhaps the most significant was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von Sch ##mitt , one of Austria ' s most capable chiefs of staff .
The battle was fought three weeks after the Austrian capitulation at Ul ##m and three weeks before the Russo @ - @ Austrian defeat at the Battle of Aust ##er ##litz . After Aust ##er ##litz Austria withdrew from the war . The French demanded a high ind ##emn ##ity and Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor , releasing the German states from their allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire .
= = Background = =
In a series of conflicts from 1803 @ - @ 15 known as the Napoleonic Wars , various European powers formed five coal ##itions against the First French Empire . Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution ( 1789 ) , these further revolution ##ized the formation , organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militar ##ization , mainly due to mass conscription . Under the leadership of Napoleon , French power rose quickly as the Grande Arm ##ée conquered most of Europe , and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 . Napoleon ' s empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813 – 14 campaigns , resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France . Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815 , known as the Hundred Days , his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo , the pursuit of his army and himself , his abdication and b ##anish ##ment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars .

From 1803 @ - @ 06 the Third Coalition fought the First French Empire and its client states ( see table at right ) . Although several naval battles determined control of the seas , the outcome of the war was decided on the continent , predominantly in two major land operations in the Danube valley : the Ul ##m campaign in the upper Danube and the Vienna campaign , in the middle Danube valley .
Political conflicts in Vienna delayed Austria ' s entry into the Third Coalition until 1805 . After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801 , Archduke Charles - - the emperor ' s brother - - took advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan . He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803 – 04 , but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack , Lieutenant Field Marshal and Quarter ##master @ - @ General of the Army , implemented his own restructuring . Mack bypassed Charles ' method ##ical approach . Occ ##urring in the field , Mack ' s plan also undermined the overall command and organizational structure . Regardless , Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military ' s readiness . Furthermore , after mis ##read ##ing Napoleon ' s maneuvers in Württemberg , Mack also reported to Vienna on the weakness of French disp ##ositions . His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor , Francis II , to enter the conflict against France , despite Charles ' own advice to the contrary . Resp ##onding to the report and rampant anti @ - @ French fever in Vienna , Francis dismissed Charles from his post as general ##iss ##imo and appointed his Franc ##oph ##obic brother @ - @ in @ - @ law , Archduke Ferdinand , as commander .
The inexperienced Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable Charles , having neither maturity nor apt ##itude for the assignment . Although Ferdinand retained nominal command , day @ - @ to @ - @ day decisions were placed in the hands of Mack , equally ill @ - @ suited for such an important assignment . When Mack was wounded early in the campaign , he was unable to take full charge of the army . Consequently , command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp , Prince of Schwarzen ##berg , an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army .

The campaign in the upper Danube valley began in October , with several clashes in Swab ##ia . Near the Bavarian town of W ##ert ##ingen , 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) northwest of Augsburg , on 8 October the 1st Regiment of dr ##agoons , part of Mur ##at ' s Reserve Cavalry Corps , and gren ##adiers of Lann ##es ' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half its size . The Austrians were arr ##ayed in a line and unable to form their defensive squares quickly enough to protect themselves from the 4 @ , @ 000 dr ##agoons and 8 @ , @ 000 gren ##adiers . Nearly 3 @ , @ 000 Austrians were captured and over 400 were killed or wounded . A day later , at another small town , Gü ##n ##zburg - - immediately south of the Danube River - - the French 59 ##th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over the Danube and , humiliating ##ly , chased two large Austrian columns toward Ul ##m .
The campaign was not entirely bad news for Vienna . At Has ##l ##ach , Johann von Kl ##en ##au arranged his 25 @ , @ 000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and , on 11 October , the overly confident General of Division Pierre Dup ##ont de l ' É ##t ##ang attacked Kl ##en ##au ' s force with fewer than 8 @ , @ 000 men . The French lost 1 @ , @ 500 men killed and wounded . Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles and guid ##ons of the 15th and 17th Dr ##agoons , Kl ##en ##au ' s force also captured 900 men , 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons .
Kl ##en ##au ' s victory was a singular success . On 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ul ##m in preparation for a breakout to the north : one under Johann Sigismund Ries ##ch headed toward El ##ching ##en to secure the bridge there , and the other under Franz von W ##ern ##eck went north with most of the heavy artillery . Recogn ##izing the opportunity , Marshal Michel Ney hurried the rest of his VI Corps forward to re @ - @ establish contact with Dup ##ont , who was still north of the Danube . In a two @ - @ pr ##onged attack Ney sent one division to the south of El ##ching ##en on the right bank of the Danube . This division began the assault at El ##ching ##en . At the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against Ries ##ch ' s position . After clearing Austrian pick ##ets from a bridge , the French attacked and captured a strategically located abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point . The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the French , but the Austrian infantry broke and ran . In this engagement alone , the Austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park , 6 @ , @ 000 ( out of 8 @ , @ 000 total participants ) dead , wounded or captured and four colors . Re ##isch ' s column also failed to destroy the bridges across the Danube .
Napoleon ' s lightning campaign exposed the Austrian indec ##isive command structure and poor supply apparatus . Mack completely mis ##read the French disp ##ositions and scattered his forces ; as the French defeated each unit separately , the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ul ##m fortifications . Napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to 80 @ , @ 000 men . At Ul ##m on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his encircled army of 20 @ , @ 000 infantry and 3 @ , @ 273 cavalry . The officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians , an agreement to which they held .

The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ul ##m withdrew toward Vienna , with the French in close pursuit . A Russian army under Gen . Mikhail Kut ##uz ##ov also maneuver ##ed away from the French , withdrawing to the east . At the Ill river on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by Michael von K ##ien ##m ##ayer . On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in Am ##st ##et ##ten . On 7 November the Russians arrived in St . P ##öl ##ten and crossed the Danube river the next day . Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the Danube , holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein , near the village Krem ##s , until the late afternoon .
= = = Battlefield = = =
To the east of Stein , 2 kilometers ( 1 @ . @ 2 mi ) down an old road , lay Krem ##s , with its small population of a few hundred , at the confluence of the stream of that name and the Danube . To the west of Stein the Danube made a large curve , creating a crescent @ - @ shaped flood ##plain between it and the mountains . At the far western end of the flood ##plain , where the mountains came down almost to the river ' s edge , was Dü ##ren ##stein with its castle , known as Schl ##oss Dü ##ren ##stein . The castle had served as a prison for Richard I of England in 119 ##3 . In 1645 – 46 , during the Thirty Years War , the Swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when they withdrew . It stands at 159 meters ( 52 ##2 ft ) , on the highest ridge of a mountain fiss ##ured with cle ##fts and pinn ##acles of granite . Because the mountain was sparsely veget ##ated , it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks . Narrow canyons cut through the mountain , and widen into the plain below . Between Dü ##ren ##stein and Stein , on the flood plain , lay the hamlets of Ober ##lo ##ib ##en and Unter ##lo ##ib ##en . Near the hamlets , the Lo ##ib ##en flood plain was at its widest , extending at the most 76 ##2 meters ( 2 @ , @ 500 ft ) from the base of the Lo ##ib ##enberg mountain to the bank of the river .
The region was known for its wine . Since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced v ##itic ##ulture and the wine producers formed St . Paul V ##int ##ners ' Guild in 144 ##7 , the oldest such guild in the German @ - @ speaking world . Ter ##r ##aced vine ##yards extended up the sides of the Krem ##s River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation . The Lo ##ib ##en plain supported both v ##itic ##ulture and agriculture . As the terrain became st ##eeper , the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Ur ##g ##est ##ein , primordial rock . From Dü ##ren ##stein to Krem ##s the river makes its wide curve ; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line @ - @ of @ - @ sight between the two towns .

Napoleon had calculated that Kut ##uz ##ov would withdraw toward Vienna , expecting reinforcements from Russia ; he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna , and that this battle would decide the war . Consequently , Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande Arm ##ée to create a new VIII Corps . This corps was to secure the north shore of the Danube , block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and , more importantly , prevent Kut ##uz ##ov from crossing the river and escaping to Russia .
The new VIII Corps , under the overall command of Éd ##ouard Mort ##ier , included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry ( see Order of Battle below ) . Corps Mort ##ier , as it was known , crossed the Danube at Lin ##z and Pass ##au in early November 1805 and marched east , on the north bank of the Danube . Operating independently , the corp ' s cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks . Gen . Gaz ##an ' s division ( about 6 @ , @ 000 men ) took the lead ; Mort ##ier was with them . They were followed by Gen . Dup ##ont ' s division ( another 4 @ , @ 000 ) about one day ' s march behind . Jean @ - @ Baptiste Dum ##on ##ce ##au ' s division ( another 4 @ , @ 000 ) , marching another day behind Dup ##ont , brought up the rear . A flotilla of 50 boats acquired at Pass ##au provided communications across the Danube . Before sending Mort ##ier on his mission , Napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible Russian reinforcements , advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders . Napoleon also advised Mort ##ier to secure all crossings of the Danube between Lin ##z and Vienna .
On 9 November Gaz ##an ' s division reached Mar ##bach an der Don ##au and covered the 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) to Dü ##ren ##stein by early on the following afternoon . Here it skirm ##ished with some Russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them . Feeling confident , the French established a forward post just upstream from Stein . In Dü ##ren ##stein itself Mort ##ier set up his command post and directed the establishment of a small field hospital . Although the position seemed secure , he had ignored Napoleon ' s strict instructions and neglected to protect his left ( north ) flank .
This failure was an important factor when Mort ##ier lost his corps ' so @ - @ called " eyes " : after he and Gaz ##an had crossed the Danube , the French dr ##agoons had ve ##ered to the northwest , leaving only three squadrons of the 4th Dr ##agoons available for reconnaissance . These had left the division and were operating independently of Gaz ##an ' s command . Consequently , Mort ##ier and Gaz ##an marched blind ##ly through the narrow canyon west of Dü ##ren ##stein , not knowing what lay ahead of them . Kut ##uz ##ov had led the Coalition army across the Danube at Krem ##s , a short distance past Stein , and destroyed the bridge behind him . His actions deprived the French commanders of a possible route across the Danube , putting the deployment of the entire French division at further risk in the case of retreat . In this decision Kut ##uz ##ov abandoned Vienna to the French , who were conver ##ging on the Austrian capital from the north , west and southwest , for the security of uniting with reinforcements from Gal ##icia . Kut ##uz ##ov chose a military solution over a political one .
Unknown to either Gaz ##an or Mort ##ier , the Coalition had concentrated a force of approximately 24 @ , @ 000 men ( mostly Russians and a few Austrians ) within a few kilometers of the French position at Dü ##ren ##stein . In comparison , Gaz ##an ' s division had only 6 @ , @ 000 men . The Austro @ - @ Russian force was a mixture of infantry , J ##ä ##gers ( usually deployed as skirm ##ishers ) , Russian musk ##eteers and Russian and Austrian cavalry , accompanied by more than 68 artillery pieces . Kut ##uz ##ov , who had learned the military arts under the tut ##elage of the legendary Russian General ##iss ##imo Su ##vor ##ov , had overall command . The Russian cavalry , units of the greatly feared Coss ##acks , were well @ - @ suited for patrolling the river bank ; indeed , on 9 November they had taken 40 French soldiers as prisoners . Furthermore , reinforcements stood in Moravia , less than two weeks ' march away . If the main body of the French army crossed the river , they would require time to prepare . Kut ##uz ##ov would have ample warning of any large @ - @ scale French movement .
After the afternoon ' s initial skirm ##ishing with the French , Kut ##uz ##ov held a council of war on the evening of 10 November at Mel ##k , at the great abbey there . He knew several things . First , he knew the positions of the French from prisoners his Coss ##acks had captured . He also knew that Gaz ##an had crossed at Lin ##z and was well ahead of any French reinforcements : Dup ##ont had crossed at Pass ##au and , by 10 November , stood at Mar ##bach , 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) upstream , and Dum ##on ##ce ##au was another 7 kilometers ( 4 mi ) further behind him . Kut ##uz ##ov knew the size of the French force - - its division strength - - and its positions , and he knew that most of the dr ##agoons were not covering the French flank but had turned north . He also knew , or had made a good supp ##osition , about Napoleon ' s orders , so he knew what to offer Mort ##ier and Gaz ##an as bait .
= = = Battle plan = = =
In addition to the Russian generals , the council included Austrian commanders Lieutenant Field Marshal Johann Heinrich von Sch ##mitt and Friedrich Karl Wilhelm , Fürst zu Hohen ##lo ##he . Sch ##mitt , who had retired from the military in 1800 , had been recalled into service after the Ul ##m deb ##acle and had come to Kut ##uz ##ov highly recommended by the Emperor . He was an experienced tact ##ician and strateg ##ist and had served in a variety of posts in the Habsburg military ; he had been Archduke Charles ' trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1800 and had assisted in planning several of Charles ' victories . Upon his recall , Sch ##mitt was appointed Chief of the Quarter ##master General Staff of the Coalition Army . The generals had found among the Austrian force one Capt . Christ ##oph Fre ##i ##herr von St ##ie ##bar ( 1753 – 1824 ) , who had knowledge of the local geography .
Together , Sch ##mitt , Kut ##uz ##ov and the other generals , with von St ##ie ##bar ' s advice on the local terrain , conc ##oct ##ed a plan to encirc ##le the French at Dü ##ren ##stein . Russian commander Mikhail And ##rey ##evich Mil ##or ##ad ##ovich would approach Gaz ##an ' s division from the east , supported by Petr Bag ##ration ' s corps , and pin the French in place . Three additional columns , commanded by Dmit ##ry D ##ok ##ht ##uro ##v ( Doctor ##ov ) , Maj . Gen . St ##rik and Sch ##mitt , would outfl ##ank the French from the west and the north . They would offer , as bait , a rumor : the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at Krem ##s .
= = Battle = =
On the night of 10 – 11 November a Russian column under St ##rik ' s command began its passage through the narrow canyons , intent on arriving at Dü ##ren ##stein by noon ; two more columns , under D ##ok ##ht ##or ##ov and Sch ##mitt , moved in wider semicirc ##les , planning to pass through the mountains and attack the French , who were extended along the river bank . According to the plan , in late morning St ##rik ' s column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right . This flanking attack , combined with Mil ##or ##ad ##ovich ' s frontal assault from Stein , would force the French into a v ##ise ; encircled , they would have no option but to surrender - - or die . To ensure the success of the plan , the second and third columns , under D ##ok ##ht ##or ##ov and Sch ##mitt , would arrive in early and mid @ - @ afternoon and support the earlier assaults . In this way , even if the French tried to retreat west to Mar ##bach , they would not escape the v ##ise @ - @ like grip of the Coalition army .
Mort ##ier accepted the bait of a rumored Russian retreat . In the early morning of 11 November he and Gaz ##an departed from Dü ##ren ##stein to seize Stein and Krem ##s , presum ##ing the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear @ - @ guard behind . As they approached Stein , a column of Mil ##or ##ad ##ovich ' s troops attacked the French forward positions . Th ##inking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard , Mort ##ier ordered Gen . Gaz ##an to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein . Fighting spread though the villages of Ober ##lo ##ib ##en , Unter ##lo ##ib ##en and the farm at Rot ##hen ##hof . Instead of withdrawing , as a rear guard would , more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column .
Initially Gaz ##an made rapid progress , but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army . Realizing he had been d ##up ##ed and that Gaz ##an ' s troops were t ##iring rapidly , Mort ##ier sent orders to Dup ##ont ' s division to hur ##ry forward . By mid @ - @ morning the French momentum had stalled ; Mort ##ier committed most of his remaining forces to driving Mil ##or ##ad ##ovich back , leaving a single battalion - - perhaps 300 troops - - to cover his northern flank , and sent the rest to attack the Russian right . Within 30 minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought . His 4 @ , @ 500 French opposed 2 @ , @ 600 Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river . Mil ##or ##ad ##ovich had no option , for neither St ##rik ' s nor D ##ok ##ht ##or ##ov ' s flanking columns were to be seen .
At this stage of the battle fighting paus ##ed . Mort ##ier and Gaz ##an waited for Dup ##ont ' s arrival while Kut ##uz ##ov and Mil ##or ##ad ##ovich waited for St ##rik ' s and D ##ok ##ht ##uro ##v ' s . Sch ##mitt ' s column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance . The timing of the respite varies , depending on whose reports are consulted : fighting paus ##ed at around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 . St ##rik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gaz ##an ' s line with three battalions , pushing the French out of Dü ##ren ##stein . C ##aught between two strong forces , Gaz ##an attempted to push his way back through Dü ##ren ##stein , to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops . With ##d ##raw ##ing through the narrow Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear , Gaz ##an and his division were trapped when more of St ##rik ' s Russians appeared to block their retreat . The narrow def ##iles hampered the Russians ; St ##rik ' s men had to march out of the canyons , form ranks and attack in waves . Despite St ##rik ' s continuous assault in the next two to three hours , Mort ##ier and Gaz ##an pushed the Russians back up the narrow fiss ##ure in the hillside . At this point , D ##ok ##ht ##uro ##v ' s column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle . The French were outnumbered more than three to one , assaulted in the front by Mil ##or ##ad ##ovich ' s column , in the middle by St ##rik ' s and in the rear by D ##ok ##ht ##uro ##v .
Earlier in the morning Dup ##ont had proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from Mar ##bach , according to instructions . Even before the arrival of Mort ##ier ' s courier , he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause . They came back to report that a Russian column ( D ##ok ##ht ##uro ##v ' s ) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dü ##ren ##stein . Realizing this would separate him from the forward division , Dup ##ont hust ##led his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank . The French assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused D ##ok ##ht ##uro ##v ' s troops to turn their attention from Gaz ##an ' s bel ##e ##agu ##ered force to face these new assail ##ants . Although superior in numbers , D ##ok ##ht ##uro ##v ' s column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size . It was D ##ok ##ht ##uro ##v ' s turn to face attackers at his front and rear , until the arrival of Sch ##mitt ' s column , which had w ##ended its way through the mountains in the west .
Sch ##mitt arrived at dusk , and the action continued well after dark ; in mid @ - @ November night falls at close to 17 : 00 in the upper Danube cl ##imes . Despite the darkness , Sch ##mitt descended out of the def ##iles and deployed his troops to assail Dup ##ont ' s flank . As his Russians entered the fr ##ay , they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians . With the additional force , the French were overwhelmed , but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark . Under the cover of darkness , Mort ##ier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank . The French and Russians continued to skirmish fit ##fully into the night as sent ##ries encountered one another in the dark . Portions of Gaz ##an ' s force provided any necessary rear guard action , and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the Danube , while they maintained possession of only Sp ##itz and Weiss ##enk ##irc ##hen on the north bank .
= = = Losses = = =
The losses were stagg ##ering : Gaz ##an lost close to 40 percent of his division to death and wounds . Aside from losing five guns , 47 officers and 895 men under his command were captured , bringing the loss of effect ##ives closer to 60 percent ; furthermore , he lost the eagles of the 4th Infantry Regiment ( France ) and the eagle and guid ##on of the 4th Dr ##agoons . The Russians lost around 4 @ , @ 000 , about 16 percent of their force , and two regimental colors . The Austrian Lieutenant Field Marshal Sch ##mitt was killed as the battle concluded , probably by Russian musket ##ry in the confused melee . The vine ##yards and the villages of Ober - and Unter ##lo ##ib ##en were destroyed , as was most of Dü ##ren ##stein and Stein . Krem ##s was heavily damaged ; the French plundered the town at least twice , and " barbar ##ously handled " its inhabitants .
= = Aftermath = =
Both sides claimed victory . Although losses were fairly equal in terms of numbers - - 4 , 000 wounded or dead on each side - - the Coalition forces went into battle with 24 @ , @ 000 men while the French started with Gaz ##an ' s division of about 6 @ , @ 000 , which grew close to 8 @ , @ 000 when Dup ##ont ' s men joined the fighting in the afternoon . Regardless , Gaz ##an ' s division was nearly destroyed ; the 30 percent losses experienced by the French fell predominantly on his division . Clear ##ly for both sides , the fighting was hard . The weather had been cold ; an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways , and i ##c ##icles " like ch ##andel ##iers " hung from the trees .
For the Coalition , the Russians were secure on the north bank of the Danube , awaiting reinforcements from Gal ##icia ; the bridges between Lin ##z and Vienna had been destroyed , making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult , but not impossible . After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news , the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory . The French had retreated from the field with a badly m ##aul ##ed division and Kut ##uz ##ov had secured the right flank . Indeed , Francis was so pleased with the outcome at Dü ##ren ##stein that he awarded Kut ##uz ##ov the Military Order of Maria Theresa .
For the French , the survival of the Corps Mort ##ier seemed nothing short of a miracle . The remainder of Gaz ##an ' s division crossed the river the next morning and eventually recuper ##ated in Vienna , which the French acquired by deception later in the month . More importantly for them , the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions . Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft . They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at Krem ##s , overturn ##ing their boats . T ##oss ##ed into the icy river , most had drowned . Despite this initial panic , Gaz ##an ' s column retained its cohesion , and responded well to various difficult demands . Dup ##ont had demonstrated his tactical ac ##umen : when he heard cannon fire , he directed his troops toward it to support the French division . In terms of French staff ##ing , Mort ##ier ' s failure to guard his flank , especially in the face of Napoleon ' s direct advice , adversely influenced his relationship with his commander . However , in the immediate weeks ahead , the flamboyant Mur ##at did more to annoy Napoleon than Mort ##ier had . In assessing the battle and its aftermath , historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on Mort ##ier and Gaz ##an : " Napoleon , aware of Mort ##ier ' s danger and his own culp ##ability for it , v ##ented his frustration on Mur ##at , whom he unjust ##ly accused of abandoning Mort ##ier for the empty glory of riding through Vienna . "
After the victory at Aust ##er ##litz , Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and reassigned Mort ##ier . However disappointed he may have been with Mort ##ier , Napoleon was pleased with Gaz ##an ' s performance . As recognition of his conduct in what the French called " the immortal Battle of Dü ##ren ##stein " , Gaz ##an received the Officer ' s Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor .
The loss of Sch ##mitt was a significant blow to the Austrian military organization . Called out of retirement for this specific task , he was one of their most experienced general staff officers , other than the Archduke Charles . From the summer of 1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of the Quarter ##master General Staff of the Army , the Lower Rhine , the Rhine and the Army of Germany . Furthermore , he was a trusted member of Archduke Charles ' staff . He had helped to design several of Charles ' more important victories at Emm ##ending ##en , Sch ##li ##eng ##en , the sie ##ges at Ke ##hl and Hü ##n ##igen , the battles at Ost ##rach and Stock ##ach , and the northern Swiss Campaign of 1799 that included battles at Winter ##thur and Zürich . An experienced officer and excellent tact ##ician , he might well have made a more effective Chief of the Quarter ##master General Staff of the Coalition Army at the Battle of Aust ##er ##litz than his eventual replacement , Franz von Wey ##ro ##ther . In Sch ##mitt ' s absence Wey ##ro ##ther , the architect of the Austrian catastrophe at Hohen ##l ##ind ##en in 1800 , was chosen to develop the general battle plan of Coalition action at Aust ##er ##litz . Sch ##mitt , undoubtedly a far better tact ##ician than Wey ##ro ##ther , and possessed of superior training and mapping skills , would have developed a more realistic Coalition plan for Aust ##er ##litz . Sch ##mitt ' s presence would probably not have been enough to turn that defeat into a victory , but it would have mit ##igated the magnitude of the Coalition ' s losses ; Aust ##er ##litz was considered one of Napoleon ' s finest triumph ##s .
In the broader picture , despite the important major naval engagements , the outcome of the War of the Third Coalition was determined on the Continent , predominantly in the two major land operations . In the Ul ##m campaign , the Habsburg ##s achieved some minor victories , such as Kl ##en ##au ' s at Has ##l ##ach @ - @ Jung ##ingen , but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps . The latter would not resume arms against France until formally exchanged . This condition crippled the Austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pension ##ers as Sch ##mitt out of retirement . After the capitulation at Ul ##m , isolated portions of the Austrian military evaded capture and joined with their Russian allies ; Michael von K ##ien ##m ##ayer ' s corps slipped out of the encirclement and joined Kut ##uz ##ov ' s force . A few other small forces refused to capit ##ulate and seemingly melted into the Bavarian mountains and the Th ##urg ##ing ##ian forests , to reappear in Bohemia for Aust ##er ##litz . Sixteen hundred cavalry , including Archduke Ferdinand and Prince Schwarzen ##berg , broke out of Ul ##m before its capitulation . Maximilian , Count of Mer ##vel ##d ##t , led his column back through the mountains into Austria , fighting rear guard actions against pursuing French forces at the St ##eyer ( St ##ey ##r ) and Maria ##z ##ell . These elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the Austrians could not hold their own against the French . Between the Ul ##m capitulation and the Austrian and Russian defeat at Aust ##er ##litz , there were other minor achievements : a successful skirmish between the cavalry that escaped from Ul ##m and the French near the town of N ##ö ##rd ##ling ##en , the contested victory at Dü ##ren ##stein , and another within days at Sch ##ö ##ng ##ra ##bern .
The second determining event , the decisive French victory at the Battle of Aust ##er ##litz over the combined Russian and Austrian armies , forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition . The subsequent Peace of Press ##burg , signed on 26 December 1805 , reinforced the earlier treaties of Camp ##o Form ##io and Lun ##é ##ville . Furthermore , Austria ceded land to Napoleon ' s German allies , and paid an ind ##emn ##ity of 40 million francs . Victory at Aust ##er ##litz also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia , Russia , and Austria . These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent . Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 , in which Austria did not participate .

Until 1805 , Dü ##ren ##stein was probably best known as the village in which crus ##ader Richard the Lion ##heart was held by Leopold V , Duke of Austria . In 174 ##1 , during the War of the Austrian Succession , several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies , intent on capturing Vienna , by painting drain pipes to look like cannons , and beating on drums , thus suggesting the presence of a large force .
After 1805 , the exploits of 40 @ , @ 000 French , Russian , and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination . General Sch ##mitt ' s grave has never been found , but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor , the gate leading from the old village of Krem ##s to the hamlet of Stein . The house in which Captain von St ##ie ##bar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle . In 1840 , a Spanish lith ##ographer created an image of the battle , which was later expanded by English lith ##ographer John O ##uth ##waite . The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the Danube flotilla ( see Inf ##ob ##ox image ) on a moon ##lit night . In fact , the moon was in its last quarter phase 48 hours later , and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image .
In 1836 , Jean Antoine Sim ##é ##on Fort ( French , 1793 – 1861 ) , a historical painter , created a watercol ##or of the battle , Combat de Dür ##n ##stein le 11 nov ##emb ##re 1805 ( ( English ) Battle of Dü ##ren ##stein of 11 November 1805 ) , which is in the T ##rian ##on collection at Versailles .
In the Russian novel War and Peace , Leo Tol ##st ##oy devoted several pages to the battle , its prelude , and its aftermath , and the delivery of its news to the Tsar by Prince Andrew . Between Dü ##ren ##stein and Ross ##atz , at the edge of the Lo ##ib ##en plain , stands the " Little Frenchman " memorial ( see image ) erected in 1905 to commemorate the battle ; it bears the names of Mort ##ier , Gaz ##an , Kut ##uz ##ov , Sch ##mitt , and others on a copper @ - @ engraved plate .

In 2000 , Lesnar signed with the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) . He was sent to its developmental territory , Ohio Valley Wrestling . There , Lesnar first met future friend and manager Paul Heyman . He formed a tag team known as " The Minnesota Stret ##ching Crew " with his former college roommate , Shelton Benjamin .

In June 2002 , Lesnar won the King of the Ring tournament , defeating Bub ##ba Ray Dudley in the first round , Booker T in the quarter @ - @ finals , Test in the semi @ - @ finals , and Rob Van Dam in the finals , earning him a shot at the WWE Und ##isputed Championship at SummerSlam . On July 22 , Lesnar joined the SmackDown ! brand . After a quick feud with Hollywood Hulk Hogan in August 2002 , Lesnar defeated WWE Und ##isputed Champion , The Rock at SummerSlam to become the WWE Und ##isputed Champion and youngest WWE Champion at age 25 , a record previously held by The Rock . He also became the second fastest wrestler to win the WWE Championship since his debut ( 126 days ) behind only Ric Flair ( 113 days ) . At the time , the Und ##isputed WWE Championship was being defended on both brands , so Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff expected Lesnar to return to Raw the following night . However , SmackDown ! General Manager Stephanie McMahon announced that Lesnar was only required to defend the title on SmackDown ! , forcing Bischoff to institute a new championship for Raw ( the World Heavyweight Championship ) . The WWE Und ##isputed Championship was then renamed the WWE Championship .
Lesnar ' s rapid rise to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker , which involved a match at Unfor ##g ##iven . The match ended in a double disqualification resulting in Lesnar retaining the title . Lesnar faced The Undertaker again , at No Mercy , this time in a Hell in a Cell match . Leading up to the match , in the storyline , Lesnar broke the Undertaker ' s hand with a prop ##ane tank . Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon , the request was denied and the match went on as planned . In a match that saw both wrestlers and even Heyman covered in blood , it ended when Lesnar reversed an attempted Tombstone P ##iled ##river into his finishing F @ - @ 5 maneuver for the win . Six days after his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker , Lesnar successfully retained his WWE title in a handicap match with Heyman at the Rebellion pay @ - @ per @ - @ view against Edge .
Lesnar ' s next opponent was Big Show . Heyman was convinced more than anyone that Lesnar could not win , trying to talk him out of defending the title . Lesnar refused and faced Big Show in Madison Square Garden at the Survivor Series pay @ - @ per @ - @ view . Towards the end of the match , Lesnar delivered an F @ - @ 5 to Big Show , but when he went for the pin , Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring . This allowed Big Show to capitalize and proceeded to ch ##okes ##lam Lesnar on a steel chair . Show went on to pin Lesnar and win the title . This loss was Lesnar ' s first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar to turn for the first time in his career into a fan favorite . Following Survivor Series , Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch , and had sn ##uck a special clause saying so into his contract . In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman , Lesnar interfered in his first title defense , which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon . Lesnar hit the F @ - @ 5 on the champion , which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title . On the following episode of SmackDown ! , however , Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and , despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening , declared that Lesnar still would not get it . Lesnar was beaten down by Big Show and Angle after the main event , but would get his revenge after the show went off the air . He eventually knocked the Big Show out with a steel chair , leaving Angle alone with Lesnar . Lesnar then chased the champion out of the ring and resumed his assault that culminated when Lesnar used the F @ - @ 5 to propel Angle ' s right knee into the steel ring ##post . As par ##amed ##ics tended to a screaming Angle , Lesnar finished off the assault with a knee ##breaker on the ringside barric ##ade , breaking the champion ' s leg in storyline .
With Angle temporarily put out of action , Lesnar ' s rivalry with Heyman and the Big Show resumed , which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening . Lesnar would defeat Big Show and entered the Royal Rumble as the # 29 entry , the second to last competitor to enter the match . He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World ' s Greatest Tag Team , which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former OVW teammate , Shelton Benjamin , who were ment ##ored by Angle . Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble , which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania XI ##X .
After the Royal Rumble , Lesnar and Chris Benoit faced off against Angle , Haas , and Benjamin at No Way Out the following month and Lesnar ' s team won the match . During the match at WrestleMania , Lesnar bot ##ched a shooting star press , a move he ' d done numerous times in developmental matches , and jammed his head and neck . This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to improv ##ise the finish of the match . Lesnar would defeat Angle , after delivering an F @ - @ 5 , to win his second WWE Championship . Lesnar was diagnosed with a legitimate concussion from the bot ##ched shooting star press .
After WrestleMania , Lesnar turned his attention to John Cena , who had returned from injury in February 2003 and who had been F @ - @ 5 ' d into a ring ##post in the same manner Angle had been . Cena claimed Lesnar nearly ended his career and even named his new finishing move the " F . U . " as a j ##ab at the new champion . The feud ended in a match at Back ##lash when Lesnar defeated Cena . On the following episode of SmackDown ! , Lesnar returned to his rivalry with Big Show after he injured Rey Mysterio badly during their match at Back ##lash . Show ' s attack resulted in Mysterio being carried out on a stretcher and back board and Big Show took Mysterio off the stretcher and swung the back board into the ring ##post , compound ##ing the injury . Lesnar called out the Big Show , who demanded that Lesnar put his title on the line against him . This led to a stretcher match at Judgment Day for the title . Lesnar successfully retained his title with help from Rey Mysterio and a fork ##l ##ift . During the scripted rivalry , on SmackDown , Lesnar lifted Big Show off the top @ - @ rope in a super ##plex which caused the ring to collapse on impact .
As Lesnar and Big Show continued their rivalry , Kurt Angle returned from his neck surgery and he and Lesnar began to form a more friendly rivalry , as the two were allies yet contenders for the title . At the first ever SmackDown brand @ - @ exclusive pay @ - @ per @ - @ view in July , Vengeance , Lesnar took on Angle and Big Show in a No Dis ##qual ##ification triple threat match for his title , which ended after Angle hit the Angle Slam on both Big Show and Lesnar , pinning the champion to become WWE Champion for a fourth time .
Lesnar continued to aggressively pursue the WWE title despite his friendship with Angle . Mr . McMahon found his way into the angle , at first ber ##ating Lesnar , who had involved himself in McMahon ' s rivalry with Zach Gow ##en , for losing to Angle . This all turned out to be a sw ##erve that came into focus on the August 7 , 2003 SmackDown ! in Kel ##own ##a , British Columbia . That night , Lesnar and McMahon were to face each other in a steel cage match with Angle as the special guest referee as per McMahon ' s orders on the previous week ' s program . During the match , Lesnar had passed out due to a staged backstage incident and McMahon was set to pin him , but Angle refused to allow McMahon to win that way . As the two men began to argue , Lesnar rose to his feet , revealing the ruse to the crowd , and F @ - @ 5 ' d Angle . He then brutally beat Angle while McMahon watched , and celebrated with him afterwards , turning heel in the process . At SummerSlam , Lesnar lost to Angle when Angle made Lesnar tap out to the ankle lock . After that , Lesnar would cement his heel turn by brutal ##izing smaller wrestlers and attacking his rivals on a more consistent basis . He returned to using the F @ - @ 5 to propel his opponents ' legs into the ring ##post , as he did to Sp ##ank ##y and Gow ##en , and interfered in Angle ' s matches on two separate occasions . On the September 18 , 2003 episode of SmackDown ! , Lesnar received his third shot at Angle in as many months when he faced the champion in a sixty @ - @ minute Iron Man match for the title . Lesnar won the match and his third WWE Championship by a final count of five to four .
Lesnar successfully defended his newly won title against the debuting Paul London on October 9 edition of SmackDown ! . He returned to feuding with The Undertaker . Lesnar had previously cost Undertaker the title in a match against then @ - @ champion Kurt Angle , which granted him a shot at Lesnar ' s title . At No Mercy , Lesnar defeated Undertaker in a B ##iker Chain match . The rivalry then came to an end after The Undertaker chose to focus on Mr . McMahon .
After Paul Heyman returned to WWE as general manager of SmackDown ! , Lesnar aligned himself with his former manager . With Survivor Series coming up , Lesnar decided to challenge Angle to a traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match . Lesnar chose Big Show as his first teammate , with Heyman adding a returning Nathan Jones and a debuting Matt Morgan to bring the team number to four . Angle chose Chris Benoit and The A ##PA to join his team . However , Fa ##aroo ##q was injured during a match with Lesnar and Angle ' s team was forced to find a replacement for him . Lesnar ' s team picked A @ - @ Train to fill the fifth and final spot for them after he attacked John Cena , who refused to accept an invitation to join Lesnar ' s team . Cena instead joined Angle ' s team , and Angle added Hardcore Holly as the fifth member ; Lesnar had injured Holly the year before and he hadn ' t wrestled since . In the climax of the match , Chris Benoit became the only second wrestler to make Lesnar tap out . Lesnar faced Benoit in a singles bout two weeks later for the WWE Championship on SmackDown ! , where Lesnar won after Benoit passed out to Lesnar ' s debuting Brock Lock submission hold .
The Survivor Series event marked the first time Lesnar met Goldberg from the Raw brand . After Lesnar claimed in a backstage interview that he could beat anybody in the world , Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar , shaking hands with him before leaving with a st ##ared ##own . Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly . In the storyline , Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legit ##imately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year . At the Royal Rumble in 2004 , Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship . Later in the Royal Rumble match , Lesnar attacked Goldberg and delivered an F @ - @ 5 , enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him .

In February , Lesnar faced Eddie Guerrero for the WWE title at No Way Out . Late in the match , Goldberg delivered a spear to Lesnar while the ref was unconscious . Afterwards , Guerrero went to pin Lesnar but Lesnar kicked out at two . Lesnar then attempted to F @ - @ 5 Guerrero but Guerrero reversed it into a DDT . Guerrero then hit a frog splash ; pinning Lesnar to win the WWE Championship . An angry Lesnar then began feuding with Goldberg , blaming him for losing his title , and a match was set up between the two at WrestleMania XX . During the feud with Goldberg , Lesnar was also at odds with Stone Cold Steve Austin , who was shown suggesting to Goldberg that he attack Lesnar at No Way Out . After Lesnar attacked Austin on Raw and stole his four @ - @ whe ##eler , Austin was inserted as the special guest referee for the WrestleMania match . On the March 4 episode of SmackDown , Lesnar defeated Hardcore Holly in his last match on a weekly WWE televised show . Behind the scenes , it was widely known that the match was Goldberg ' s last in WWE . Only a week before WrestleMania , rumors surfaced that Lesnar , too , was leaving to pursue a career in the National Football League ( NFL ) . As a result , Lesnar ' s match with Goldberg became a f ##iasco as the fans at Madison Square Garden je ##ered and heck ##led both wrestlers voc ##iferous ##ly . Goldberg gained victory after delivering a Jack ##hammer to Lesnar and both men subsequently received Stone Cold St ##un ##ners from Austin .

On October 8 , 2005 , Lesnar won the IW ##GP Heavyweight Championship on his debut match in a three @ - @ way match with Kaz ##uy ##uki Fuj ##ita and Mas ##ah ##iro Ch ##ono at a New Japan Pro Wrestling ( NJ ##P ##W ) show in the Tokyo Dome . Lesnar is one of the few American wrestlers to have held this title . He won the match by pinning Mas ##ah ##iro Ch ##ono after an F @ - @ 5 , which he had renamed the Verdict since WWE owns the trademark on the F @ - @ 5 name . After the match , Lesnar stated that this name was referring to his lawsuit against WWE .
On December 6 , WWE filed a motion for a temporary restr ##aining order to prevent Lesnar from continuing to work with NJ ##P ##W , but the court did not grant it . Following that , he had two non @ - @ title victories against Man ##abu Nak ##anish ##i and Yu ##ji Nag ##ata . Lesnar successfully defended his championship on January 4 , 2006 , against former champion Sh ##ins ##uke Nak ##amura . On January 13 , WWE once again filed an injunction against Lesnar to stop him from defending the IW ##GP Heavyweight Championship which was also not enforced as he went on to retain his championship against former Sum ##o Wrestling Grand Champion Ak ##eb ##ono on March 19 , at the Sum ##o Hall . Lesnar had another successful title defense against Giant Bernard on May 3 , 2006 . This was the first American vs . American title match in NJ ##P ##W since Vader vs . Stan Hansen in 1990 .
On July 15 , 2006 , New Japan Pro Wrestling announced Lesnar would not return to defend the IW ##GP Heavyweight Championship due to " visa issues " and had been stripped of the title . A tournament was held on July 16 to determine the new champion which was won by Hiro ##shi Tan ##ah ##ashi . Lesnar continued to possess the physical IW ##GP Championship belt until late June 2007 .
Approximately one year later on June 29 , 2007 , Lesnar defended his IW ##GP Heavyweight Championship against TNA World Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle in a champion versus champion match . In ##oki Gen ##ome Federation promoter Antonio In ##oki had stated Lesnar was the " proper " IW ##GP Heavyweight Champion as he was not defeated for the title . Angle would defeat Lesnar by forcing him to tap out to the Angle lock to win the IW ##GP Heavyweight Championship as recognized by IG ##F and Total N ##onst ##op Action Wrestling ( TNA ) . This was Lesnar ' s last match as a professional wrestler until 2012 , when he re @ - @ signed with WWE .

Lesnar had previously signed a non @ - @ compete clause in order to be released from his contract with WWE , which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010 . However , he decided to challenge this ruling in court . WWE responded with a counter ##claim after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro Wrestling show in 2004 . In July 2005 , the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship . WWE had offered Lesnar a contract , but on August 2 , 2005 , WWE ' s official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company . The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21 , but did not get solved .
On January 14 , 2006 , Judge Christopher D ##ron ##ey stated that unless WWE gave him a good argument between then and the 25th , he would rule in favor of Lesnar , giving him a summary judgment . This would have enabled Lesnar to work anywhere , immediately . WWE was later granted a deadline postp ##on ##ement . On April 24 , WWE announced on WWE . com that both parties had reached a settlement . On June 12 , a federal judge dismissed the case at the request of both legal parties .

Cena then delivered the Att ##itude Ad ##just ##ment to Lesnar onto steel steps and Lesnar lost the match .
The following night on Raw , WWE ' s Chief Operating Officer Triple H refused to give in to Lesnar ' s unreasonable contract demands ( which included being given his own personal jet and having Raw renamed to Monday Night Raw Starring Brock Lesnar ) , resulting in Lesnar attacking him and breaking his arm with a Kim ##ura lock in storyline .

The following week on Raw , Punk challenged Lesnar to a match at SummerSlam , where Lesnar defeated Punk in a no disqualification match .
On the December 30 episode of Raw , Lesnar returned with Heyman to announce his intentions to challenge the winner of the upcoming WWE World Heavyweight Championship match between Randy Orton and John Cena at the Royal Rumble .

On the August 19 episode of Main Event , Triple H announced that Cena was inv ##oking his championship rematch clause against Lesnar at Night of Champions , where Lesnar was disqualified due to Seth Rollins interfering , but retained his championship , which could not be lost via disqualification . Later in the year , after Rollins reunited with The Authority , he was added to Lesnar and Cena ' s championship match at Royal Rumble , making it a triple threat match , which Lesnar won despite suffering a storyline broken rib during the match .
Lesnar ' s next challenger was Roman Reign ##s , who won the Royal Rumble match to earn the right to face Lesnar for the title at WrestleMania 31 . During his main @ - @ event match against Reign ##s , Lesnar delivered multiple su ##plex ##es and was heard exclaim ##ing , " Sup ##lex City , bitch ! " , and thereafter " Sup ##lex City " became one of his signature catchph ##r ##ases and merchandise motifs . After Lesnar and Reign ##s traded a few false finishes , Rollins cas ##hed in his Money in the Bank contract while the match was in progress , making it a triple threat ; Rollins then pinned Reign ##s to win the title . The following night on Raw , Lesnar tried to inv ##oke his rematch clause and subsequently attacked commentators Booker T , John " Bradshaw " Lay ##field , and Michael Cole , as well as a cameraman after Rollins refused the rematch , which led to Stephanie McMahon susp ##ending Lesnar indefinitely in storyline .
Lesnar returned on the June 15 episode of Raw as a fan favorite , being chosen by The Authority as the number one contender to Rollins ' WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Battle ##ground . On July 4 , Lesnar made his first non @ - @ televised wrestling appearance for WWE since his 2012 return , defeating K ##of ##i Kingston at The Beast in the East live event in Tokyo in a quick winning effort ; he also delivered F @ - @ 5 ##s to Kingston ' s New Day stable ##mates Big E and Xavier Woods after the match . On July 19 at Battle ##ground , Lesnar dominated Rollins , delivering 13 su ##plex ##es ; mid @ - @ pinfall , after performing an F @ - @ 5 , he was attacked by The Undertaker , who incapacitated Lesnar with a ch ##okes ##lam and two Tombstone P ##iled ##r ##ivers ; this ended the match , with Lesnar winning by disqualification and Rollins retaining the championship .

The following night on Raw , Undertaker explained that he had attacked Lesnar not for ending his WrestleMania streak , but rather for Lesnar allowing Heyman to constantly t ##aunt Undertaker about it ; this led to the two b ##rawling throughout the arena and a WrestleMania rematch being scheduled for SummerSlam on August 23 , where Undertaker would controversially defeat Lesnar ; during the match , Undertaker tapped out to a Kim ##ura lock by Lesnar and the time ##keeper rang the bell , but the referee did not see the tap ##out and demanded that the match continue , which saw Undertaker then hitting Lesnar with a low blow and Lesnar passed out to Undertaker ' s submission hold , Hell ' s Gate . The following night on Raw , Lesnar and Heyman challenged Undertaker to an immediate rematch , only to be confronted by Bo Dallas , who mocked Lesnar about his defeat ; Lesnar then responded by delivering 3 German su ##plex ##es and an F @ - @ 5 to Dallas .
During Night of Champions , it was announced that Lesnar would face The Undertaker at the Hell in a Cell pay @ - @ per @ - @ view , where Lesnar defeated The Undertaker after a low blow and F @ - @ 5 onto the exposed ring floor , ending their feud . The match was later voted " Match of the Year " during the 2015 Slam ##my Awards . On the January 11 episode of Raw , Lesnar returned , attacking The New Day , The League of Nations ( Sheamus , King Barrett , Rus ##ev , and Alberto Del Rio ) , and Kevin Owens , before giving an F @ - @ 5 to Roman Reign ##s . The following week on Raw , Lesnar would brawl with Reign ##s until they were both attacked by The Wyatt Family . At the Royal Rumble , Lesnar was the 23rd entr ##ant , eliminating four competitors before being eliminated by Bray Wyatt with help from the rest of The Wyatt Family .
On the January 25 episode of Raw , Stephanie McMahon announced that the main event of Fast ##lane would be a triple threat match between Lesnar , Roman Reign ##s , and Dean Ambrose to determine who would face Triple H for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 32 . In the following weeks , Lesnar would be continuously provoked by Ambrose , with Reign ##s saving him from the subsequent attacks by Lesnar . At Fast ##lane , Lesnar dominated most of the match before he was put through two announce tables by Ambrose and Reign ##s ; he would ultimately lose the match after Reign ##s pinned Ambrose . Because of this , Lesnar attacked Ambrose in the parking lot as he was arriving at the arena for Raw , but Ambrose would return later in the night , having hijacked an ambulance , and he challenged Lesnar to a No Hold ##s Bar ##red Street Fight match at WrestleMania 32 , where Lesnar defeated Ambrose . On the July 7 edition of SmackDown , it was announced that Lesnar would be facing the returning Randy Orton at SummerSlam . On July 19 , at the 2016 WWE Draft , Lesnar was drafted to Raw .
= = Football career = =
After his match at WrestleMania XX , Lesnar sidelined his career in WWE to pursue a career in the National Football League ( NFL ) despite not playing American football since high school . The WWE issued this statement on their official website , WWE . com , following his departure :
Brock Lesnar has made a personal decision to put his WWE career on hold to prepare to try ##out for the National Football League this season . Brock has wrestled his entire professional career in the WWE and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new ende ##avor .
Lesnar later told a Minnesota radio show that he had " three wonderful years " in WWE , but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play pro football , adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have " made it " in football . In an interview about the NFL , he stated :
This is no load of bull ; it ' s no WWE stunt . I am dead serious about this . I ain ' t afraid of anything and I ain ' t afraid of anybody . I ' ve been an under ##dog in athletics since I was five . I got zero college offers for wrestling . Now people say I can ' t play football , that it ' s a joke . I say I can . I ' m as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the NFL , if not better . I ' ve always had to fight for everything . I wasn ' t the best technician in amateur wrestling but I was strong , had great conditioning , and a hard head . Nobody could break me . As long as I have that , I don ' t give a damn what anybody else thinks .
Lesnar had a great showing at the NFL Combine . On April 17 , 2004 , a min ##ivan collided with his motor ##b ##ike ; he suffered a broken jaw and left hand , a bruised pel ##vis , and a pulled groin . Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching Lesnar work out . The Minnesota Vikings worked out Lesnar on June 11 , 2004 but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident . On July 24 it was reported that he was nearly recovered from his groin injury . He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team . He was released by the Vikings on August 30 , 2004 . Lesnar received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family . He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings .

On April 29 , 2006 , after the final match of the K @ - @ 1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Las Vegas , Lesnar announced his intent to join K @ - @ 1 ' s mixed martial arts league , Hero ' s . He trained with Minnesota Mart ##ial Arts Academy under Greg Nelson and Minnesota Assistant Head wrestling coach Marty Morgan . Lesnar announced on August 12 in Las Vegas that he had signed a deal with the K @ - @ 1 promotion . His first fight was scheduled against Ch ##oi Hong @ - @ man of Korea on June 2 , 2007 , at the K @ - @ 1 Dyn ##am ##ite ! ! USA show .

During UFC 77 , it was announced that Lesnar had reached a deal to fight with the Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) . On February 2 , 2008 , Lesnar made his debut with the promotion in an event titled UFC 81 : Breaking Point against former UFC Heavyweight Champion , Frank Mir . Due to his large hands , Lesnar was wearing 4 ##X ##L gloves for the fight , making him the second man in Nevada ' s combat sports history to wear such gloves after Ch ##oi Hong @ - @ man . Lesnar secured an early t ##akedown and began landing numerous punches but was docked a point after a punch hit Mir on the back of the head . Following another t ##akedown by Lesnar , Mir managed to secure a knee ##bar and force a submission at 1 : 30 of the first round and Lesnar lost in his UFC debut . At UFC 82 , former UFC Heavyweight Champion and Hall of F ##amer Mark Coleman was announced to fight Lesnar at UFC 87 . However , Coleman withdrew from the fight due to an injury and was replaced by Heath Herring . Lesnar defeated Herring by unanimous decision .
Lesnar would then face Randy Cout ##ure for the UFC Heavyweight Championship at UFC 91 on November 15 . Lesnar would beat Cout ##ure via a technical knockout ( T ##KO ) in the second round to become the new UFC Heavyweight Champion .
On December 27 , 2008 , at UFC 92 , Frank Mir defeated Ant ##ô ##n ##io N ##ogue ##ira for the Inter ##im Heavyweight Championship and was to face Lesnar for the Und ##isputed UFC Heavyweight Championship at UFC 98 . Immediately after winning the Inter ##im Heavyweight title , Mir found Lesnar in the crowd and shouted , " You ' ve got my belt " . Due to a knee injury to Mir , the title unification match with Lesnar that was originally slated to be the UFC 98 main event was postponed . Lesnar won the postponed rematch with Mir at UFC 100 on July 11 , 2009 , via technical knockout in the second round . The win earned Lesnar Beat ##down of the Year honors , with Anderson Silva , from Sher ##dog for 2009 . During his post @ - @ match celebration , Lesnar flipped off the crowd who had been boo ##ing him . Lesnar also made a dispar ##aging comment about the pay @ - @ per @ - @ view ' s primary sponsor Bud Light , claiming they " won ' t pay me not ##hin ' " and promoted Co ##ors Light instead . Lesnar later apologized for his remarks at the post @ - @ fight press conference , where he held a bottle of Bud Light and endorsed their product .
On July 1 , 2009 , it was reported that the winner of the Shane Car ##win vs . Cain Vel ##as ##quez fight at UFC 104 would face Lesnar but the match was scrapped and Lesnar was scheduled to defend his belt against Shane Car ##win at UFC 106 on November 21 . On October 26 , 2009 , it was announced that Lesnar pulled out of his Car ##win bout due to an illness . UFC President Dana White said Lesnar had been ill for three weeks , claiming he had never been this sick in his life and that it would take him a while to recover ; his fight with Car ##win was rescheduled for UFC 108 on January 2 , 2010 . Lesnar initially sought treatment in Canada , but later told reporters that he had received " Third World treatment " at a hospital in Brandon , Manitoba , and that seeking better treatment in the U . S . saved his life . Lesnar went on to criticize Canadian health care further and stated that he shared his experience in an effort to speak " on the behalf of the doctors in the United States that don ' t want health care reform to happen " .
On November 4 , it was confirmed that Lesnar was suffering from mon ##on ##ucle ##osis and that his bout with Car ##win would have to wait a bit longer and the fight for Lesnar ' s heavyweight championship was cancelled . On November 14 , at the UFC 105 post @ - @ fight conference , Dana White stated , " [ Lesnar ] ' s not well and he ' s not going to be getting well any ##time soon " and that an interim title match might need to be set up . In addition to mon ##on ##ucle ##osis , it was revealed that he was suffering from a serious case of divert ##ic ##ul ##itis , an intest ##inal disorder , which required surgery . After further diagnosis , Lesnar underwent surgery on November 16 to close a perfor ##ation in his intestine that had been leaking f ##ec ##al matter into his abdomen , causing pain , ab ##sc ##esses , and overt ##ax ##ing his immune system to the point that he contracted mon ##on ##ucle ##osis . From the level of damage to Lesnar ' s system , the surgeon estimated that the intest ##inal condition had been ongoing for around a year .
In January 2010 , Lesnar announced on ESPN ' s Sports ##C ##enter that he was scheduled to make a return to the UFC in the summer . A match between Frank Mir and Shane Car ##win took place on March 27 at UFC 111 to determine the Inter ##im Heavyweight Champion , and Lesnar ' s next opponent . Shane Car ##win defeated Mir via knockout in the first round , becoming the new Inter ##im Champion . After the fight , Lesnar came into the ring and stated , " It was a good fight but he ' s wearing a belt that ' s a make @ - @ believe belt . I ' ve got the real championship belt " . Lesnar faced Car ##win at UFC 116 to unify the heavyweight titles . Early in the first round , Car ##win knocked Lesnar down with punch , gave him a cut above his left eye , and used a ground and pound attack the rest of the round . In the next round , Lesnar was able to take Car ##win down , attain a full mount , then move into side @ - @ control and finish the fight with an arm triangle ch ##oke . With the victory , Lesnar became the Und ##isputed UFC Heavyweight Champion , earning his first Sub ##mission of the Night and giving Car ##win his first loss . The win also tied a UFC record for most consecutive successful Heavyweight Championship defenses .
Lesnar ' s next defense was against undefeated top contender Cain Vel ##as ##quez on October 23 , at the Honda Center in Anaheim , California at UFC 121 . Dana White announced via Sports ##N ##ation that the UFC would bring back UFC Primetime to hype the fight . He was defeated by Vel ##as ##quez for the title by T ##KO in the first round .
On January 11 , 2011 , Lesnar was announced as a coach of The Ultimate Fighter Season 13 , opposite Junior dos Santos , with the two expected to fight on June 11 at UFC 131 , however , he was struck with another bout of divert ##ic ##ul ##itis and had to withdraw from the fight on May 12 . He was replaced by Shane Car ##win , who ended up losing against dos Santos . Lesnar underwent surgery on May 27 to help battle his problems with divert ##ic ##ul ##itis . Dana White said that he had a 12 @ - @ inch piece of his colon removed .
In its May 2011 issue , ESPN ' s magazine published a story listing the highest paid athlete based on base salary and earnings for the most recent calendar year or most recent season in 30 sports . Lesnar topped the list for M ##MA at $ 5 @ . @ 3 million , which included his reported bout salaries and estimated pay @ - @ per @ - @ view bonuses .
In the summer of 2011 , Lesnar announced that he was returning to action , stating , " I feel like a new man . Health ##y . Strong . I feel like I used to feel " . His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strike ##force heavyweight champion Alistair Over ##e ##em . Over ##e ##em won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round . The result of the fight remains controversial , as Over ##e ##em tested positive for elevated levels of test ##oster ##one prior to his next fight . Lesnar then announced his retirement from M ##MA , mentioning his struggles with divert ##ic ##ul ##itis and saying " tonight was the last time you ' ll see me in the oct ##agon " .
Spec ##ulation about a return to M ##MA lasted until March 24 , 2015 , when Lesnar announced in an interview on Sports ##C ##enter that he had re @ - @ signed with WWE and officially closed the door on a return to M ##MA , even though he was offered a deal " ten times more " than what he had made previously in his M ##MA career . He further elaborated that , while he was training for months for a return to the UFC , he felt " physically great but something was lacking mentally " . Lesnar added that " [ he ' s ] an older cav ##eman now , so [ he ] makes sm ##ar ##ter cav ##eman decisions " and that he chose to sign with WWE instead of returning to M ##MA because he could " work part @ - @ time with full @ - @ time pay " .

Though Lesnar said he was " closing the door on M ##MA " in March 2015 , UFC announced on June 4 , 2016 , that he would return at UFC 200 on July 9 . WWE confirmed it had granted Lesnar " a one @ - @ off opportunity " to compete at UFC 200 before he would return to the company for SummerSlam on August 21 .
Lesnar , representing Canada for the first time in his career , defeated Mark Hunt by unanimous decision ( 29 @ - @ 27 ) , avoiding 19 of Hunt ' s 30 attempted standing strikes , and taking him down four times to land 43 significant ground strikes , 32 in the final round . He also won a UFC @ - @ record $ 2 @ . @ 5 million purse .
On July 15 , Lesnar was notified of a potential anti @ - @ d ##oping policy violation by the United States Anti @ - @ D ##oping Agency ( USA ##DA ) stemming from an undisclosed banned substance in an out @ - @ of @ - @ competition sample collected on June 28 . Shortly after this was announced , WWE said Lesnar ' s match with Randy Orton at SummerSlam would still take place . Hunt told UFC to either pay him half of Lesnar ' s purse or let him out of his contract . He later changed his mind on Twitter , and asked for the whole purse . UFC has not yet publicly responded to Hunt . Lesnar told the Associated Press , " We will get to the bottom of this . " On July 19 , the UFC announced that a second sample taken in @ - @ competition on July 9 tested positive for the same banned substance discovered in the previous out @ - @ of @ - @ competition sample .

They have two sons : Turk ( born June 3 , 2009 ) and Duke ( born July 21 , 2010 ) . Lesnar also has twins with his former fiancée , Nicole McC ##lain , the first being a son named Luke ( born Brock Jr . ) and the second a daughter named Mya Lynn ( born April 10 , 2002 ) . Mya is 10 minutes older than Luke . Lesnar has full custody of the twins , and is the stepfather of Mariah , Greek ' s daughter with her late husband .
Lesnar is a conservative and a supporter of the Republican Party . He is a member of the National Rifle Association , and made an appearance at their annual meeting in May 2011 to discuss his passion for hunting and his role as a spokesman for Fusion Am ##munition .
During his first run in WWE , Lesnar developed add ##ictions to both alcohol and pain ##kill ##ers , allegedly drinking a bottle of v ##od ##ka per day and taking hundreds of Vic ##od ##in pills per month to manage the pain caused by wear and tear on his body ; he named his accident at WrestleMania XI ##X as a particular source of pain . Lesnar claims that , as a result of his addiction and mental exhaustion , he does not remember " an entire two years " of his WWE career .
In January 2001 , Lesnar was arrested by police in Louisville , Kentucky for suspicion of possessing large amounts of an ##ab ##olic ster ##oids . The charges were dropped when it was discovered that the substances were a legal growth hormone . His lawyer described it as a " vitamin type of thing " .
On December 15 , 2011 , Lesnar was charged with hunting inf ##ract ##ions on a trip to Alberta on November 19 , 2010 . Two charges were dropped , but Lesnar pleaded guilty to the charge of improper tag ##ging of an animal . He was fined $ 1 @ , @ 725 and given a six @ - @ month hunting suspension .
As of July 2016 , Lesnar ' s eldest son , Brock Jr . is ranked # 1 in Saskatchewan and # 4 in all of Canada in amateur wrestling .

= Constant k filter =
Constant k filters , also k @ - @ type filters , are a type of electronic filter designed using the image method . They are the original and simplest filters produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components . Historically , they are the first filters that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections . However , they are rarely considered for a modern design , the principles behind them having been superseded by other method ##ologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response .
= = History = =
Constant k filters were invented by George Campbell . He published his work in 1922 , but had clearly invented the filters some time before , as his colleague at AT & T Co , Otto Z ##ob ##el , was already making improvements to the design at this time . Campbell ' s filters were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously . Campbell called his filters electric wave filters , but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others . Many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented ; an early ( and important ) variation was the m @ - @ derived filter by Z ##ob ##el who coined the term constant k for the Campbell filter in order to distinguish them .
The great advantage Campbell ' s filters had over the R ##L circuit and other simple filters of the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or steep ##ness of transition between pass band and stop band . It was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained .
The filters were designed by Campbell for the purpose of separating multiplex ##ed telephone channels on transmission lines , but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that . The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded . However , the ladder topology used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with implement ##ations of modern filter designs such as the T ##che ##by ##sche ##ff filter . Campbell gave constant k designs for low @ - @ pass , high @ - @ pass and band @ - @ pass filters . Band @ - @ stop and multiple band filters are also possible .
= = Term ##in ##ology = =
Some of the impedance terms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below . Image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cas ##cade of two @ - @ port sections , and in the case of the filters being discussed , an infinite ladder network of L @ - @ sections . Here " L " should not be confused with the induct ##ance L – in electronic filter topology , " L " refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter " L " .
The sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made of series elements having impedance 2 ##Z and sh ##unt elements with adm ##itt ##ance 2 ##Y . The factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience , since it is usual to work in terms of half @ - @ sections where it disappears . The image impedance of the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same . However , for a mid @ - @ series section ( that is , a section from halfway through a series element to halfway through the next series element ) will have the same image impedance on both ports due to symmetry . This image impedance is designated Z ##i ##T due to the " T " topology of a mid @ - @ series section . Likewise , the image impedance of a mid @ - @ sh ##unt section is designated Z ##i ##Π due to the " Π " topology . Half of such a " T " or " Π " section is called a half @ - @ section , which is also an L @ - @ section but with half the element values of the full L @ - @ section . The image impedance of the half @ - @ section is diss ##im ##ilar on the input and output ports : on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the mid @ - @ series Z ##i ##T , but on the side presenting the sh ##unt element it is equal to the mid @ - @ sh ##unt Z ##i ##Π . There are thus two variant ways of using a half @ - @ section .

The building block of constant k filters is the half @ - @ section " L " network , composed of a series impedance Z , and a sh ##unt adm ##itt ##ance Y . The " k " in " constant k " is the value given by ,
< formula >
Thus , k will have units of impedance , that is , oh ##ms . It is readily apparent that in order for k to be constant , Y must be the dual impedance of Z . A physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value of Z ##i as the size of the section ( in terms of values of its components , such as induct ##ances , capac ##it ##ances , etc . ) approaches zero , while keeping k at its initial value . Thus , k is the characteristic impedance , Z ##0 , of the transmission line that would be formed by these inf ##in ##ites ##im ##ally small sections . It is also the image impedance of the section at resonance , in the case of band @ - @ pass filters , or at ω = 0 in the case of low @ - @ pass filters . For example , the pictured low @ - @ pass half @ - @ section has
< formula > .
Elements L and C can be made arbit ##r ##arily small while retaining the same value of k . Z and Y however , are both approaching zero , and from the form ##ulae ( below ) for image imped ##ances ,

The image imped ##ances of the section are given by

Given that the filter does not contain any resist ##ive elements , the image impedance in the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary . For example , for the pictured low @ - @ pass half @ - @ section ,

The transition occurs at a cut @ - @ off frequency given by

Below this frequency , the image impedance is real ,

The transmission parameters for a general constant k half @ - @ section are given by

For the low @ - @ pass L @ - @ shape section , below the cut @ - @ off frequency , the transmission parameters are given by

That is , the transmission is loss ##less in the pass @ - @ band with only the phase of the signal changing . Above the cut @ - @ off frequency , the transmission parameters are :

= = = Prot ##otype transformations = = =
The presented plots of image impedance , atten ##uation and phase change correspond to a low @ - @ pass prototype filter section . The prototype has a cut @ - @ off frequency of ω ##c
= 1 rad / s and a nominal impedance k =
1 Ω . This is produced by a filter half @ - @ section with induct ##ance L
= 1 hen ##ry and capac ##it ##ance C =
1 far ##ad . This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values . The low @ - @ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @ - @ pass , band @ - @ pass or band @ - @ stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations .
= = Casc ##ading sections = =
Several L @ - @ shape half @ - @ sections may be cas ##c ##aded to form a composite filter . Like impedance must always face like in these combinations . There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L @ - @ shaped half @ - @ sections . Where a port of image impedance Z ##i ##T faces another Z ##i ##T , the section is called a Π section . Where Z ##i ##Π faces Z ##i ##Π the section so formed is a T section . Further additions of half @ - @ sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or sh ##unt elements .
It should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance . This is usually not true of the sections at either end , which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance . The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the prediction will become , since the effects of the terminating imped ##ances are masked by the intervening sections .
= The Snow ##men =
" The Snow ##men " is an episode of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on Christmas Day 2012 on BBC One . It is the eighth Christmas special since the show ' s 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul Metz ##stein .
The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) brooding with the assistance of Sil ##urian Madame V ##ast ##ra ( Nev ##e McI ##nt ##osh ) , her wife Jenny Flint ( Cat ##rin Stewart ) and S ##ont ##aran Stra ##x ( Dan Stark ##ey ) , after the loss of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams in the previous episode , " The Angels Take Manhattan " . He is forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious , sentient snow ##men that are building themselves and meets Clara Oswald ( Jenna @ - @ Louise Coleman ) , a govern ##ess also investigating the snow ##men . They discover that the snow ##men are being animated by the Great Intelligence ( voice of Ian McK ##ellen ) with the help of a man named Dr Simeon ( Richard E . Grant ) .
Building upon the character ' s surprise introduction in " Asylum of the Daleks " , " The Snow ##men " introduces Clara as the Doctor ' s new companion , though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the Doctor starting with " The Bells of Saint John " . In addition to Clara , " The Snow ##men " also introduces a redesigned TARDIS , revised title sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor ' s costume . The special was produced in August 2012 , with location filming in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 9 @ . @ 87 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth most @ - @ watched programme of Christmas Day . " The Snow ##men " was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character of Clara well . However , some felt that Grant and McK ##ellen were under ##used as villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation .

= = = Pre ##qu ##els = = =
To promote the special , three pre ##qu ##els were released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Need tel ##eth ##on on 16 November 2012 , titled " The Great Detective " . The Sil ##urian Madame V ##ast ##ra , her human wife Jenny Flint , and the S ##ont ##aran Stra ##x ( all returning from " A Good Man Goes to War " ) describe a number of strange phenomena to a sh ##adowed fourth detective . The fourth detective reveals himself to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired .
A second prequel , titled " V ##ast ##ra Investig ##ates " , was released online on 17 December 2012 . At the end of a case , V ##ast ##ra and Jenny convers ##e with an officer from Scotland Yard and apolog ##ise for Stra ##x ' s violent wishes for the culprit ' s punishment . V ##ast ##ra explains Stra ##x ' s alien origin as well as her own to the officer , much to his aston ##ishment . V ##ast ##ra reveals that she was a ##wo ##ken by an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans , though that changed when she fell in love with Jenny . On the carriage ride home , Jenny notices it is beginning to snow and V ##ast ##ra notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky .
A third prequel , titled " The Battle of Demon ' s Run — Two Days Later " was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013 . Two days after the events of " A Good Man Goes to War " , V ##ast ##ra and Jenny convince Stra ##x that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London . The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how Stra ##x was resurrected and came to be in V ##ast ##ra ' s employ .
= = = Synopsis = = =
In 1842 England , a young boy builds a snow ##man , but refuses to play with the other children . The snow ##man starts speaking to the boy , repeating his assert ##ions that the other children are silly . Fifty years later , the boy has grown up to be Dr . Walter Simeon , proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute . He hires men to collect samples of snow , which he places in a large snow @ - @ filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snow ##men . The Doctor , still desp ##ond ##ent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams , has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds . He uses his allies V ##ast ##ra , Jenny , and Stra ##x to keep people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city .
Elsewhere , b ##arm ##aid Clara Os ##win Oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by . He attempts to leave discreet ##ly , but Clara follows him to a coach . Not wishing to become involved in matters , the Doctor instructs Stra ##x to bring him a memory worm that will er ##ase the last hour of Clara ' s memories with just a touch . Before they can do so , they are surrounded by snow ##men created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group . The Doctor realises that Clara ' s thoughts are creating the snow ##men and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting . Clara caut ##ions the Doctor that if he w ##ipes her memory , she will forget how to deal with the snow ##men . The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascend ##s a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS . Clara follows him and knocks on the door , but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers . Clara returns to her other job as govern ##ess for the children of Captain Lat ##imer . She learns that Lat ##imer ' s daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous govern ##ess returning from the dead . Clara realises that the pond that contains the old govern ##ess ' body is the only thing still frozen around them . She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny , who takes her to see V ##ast ##ra . V ##ast ##ra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help . Clara chooses the word " Pond " , which sh ##ocks the Doctor and a ##rou ##ses his interest .
Acting on a tip from Stra ##x , the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes . He confronts Dr . Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon ' s office that contains psychic snow . The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence , the entity that has been speaking to Dr . Simeon since he was a boy . He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snow ##men and has taken interest in Lat ##imer ' s pond . The Doctor visits the pond and ded ##uces that the Great Intelligence is using the old govern ##ess ' body as a DNA blue ##print to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt . While Clara is putting the children to bed , the frozen body of the govern ##ess breaks into the house . The Doctor fights her off and is joined by V ##ast ##ra , Jenny and Stra ##x . Dr . Simeon arrives with more snow ##men and tells them he wants the govern ##ess ' ice body . The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS h ##overing overhead . They are pursued by the ice govern ##ess , whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals . Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key , but the ice govern ##ess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud .
The Doctor picks up Clara and takes her back to Lat ##imer ' s mansion , placing her under medical care of Stra ##x . He collects the ice fragments from the govern ##ess and places them in a souven ##ir London Underground b ##isc ##uit tin . He and V ##ast ##ra travel to Simeon ' s lab , where the Doctor notes the Intelligence ' s plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary DNA . Dr Simeon grabs the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm , which lat ##ches on to him . The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence , which has been existing as a mirror of Dr Simeon ' s thoughts , will v ##anish with the er ##asure of Simeon ' s memories . Instead , the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control Simeon ' s body , which it uses to attack V ##ast ##ra and the Doctor . The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly w ##anes , and Simeon falls dead . Outside , a salt @ - @ water rain has started , and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence : the Lat ##imer family , crying for Clara . Stra ##x informs the Doctor upon his return to the Lat ##imer mansion that Clara only has moments left , and she passes away as the Doctor returns the TARDIS key to her . At her funeral , the Doctor reads Clara ' s full name on her tomb ##stone and realises she is the woman he met in " Asylum of the Daleks " who became a Dalek , whom he refers to as " Sou ##ff ##lé Girl " . He glee ##fully announces that a person dying twice is an imposs ##ibility and , bidding farewell to his allies for now , the Doctor departs in the TARDIS to investigate and find Clara . The episode concludes in contemporary times , where a young woman resembling Clara walks through the same graveyard , paus ##ing by Clara ' s tomb ##stone .

The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The Ab ##omin ##able Snow ##men ( 1967 ) , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear ( 1968 ) , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robot Yet ##i as its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in " The Snow ##men " when he presents the London Underground b ##isc ##uit tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr Simeon ' s laboratory ; the Intelligence states , " I do not understand these markings " , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a " key strategic weakness in metropolitan living " , referring to ( and possibly setting in motion ) the future Yet ##i attack on London via the Underground .
Coleman previously played Os ##win Oswald in " Asylum of the Daleks " , though the connection between the two characters is not clarified until Clara reveals she has an interest in sou ##ff ##l ##és , a trait that Os ##win ' s character also had . The Doctor , after meeting Clara , w ##ist ##fully replies " those were the days " when she asks why he isn ' t staying to get acquainted with her , which are the same words he tells Craig Owens ( " Cl ##osing Time " ) when Craig comments that the Doctor always wins . The final scenes at the graveyard establish that Clara shares the same name as Os ##win , leading the Doctor to surm ##ise they are the same person . As seen on her grav ##estone , Clara ' s birth ##d ##ate is 23 November , the date Doctor Who was first transmitted in 1963 .

Writer Steven Moffat stated that he wanted an " epic " quality to the Christmas special . The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous companions ; Moffat said that " I think he ' s probably reached the point in his life where he ' s saying , ' Friendship for me is just postponed b ##ere ##avement — I want to be on my own for a while ' . " Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor ( William Hart ##nell ) in 1963 and the Ninth Doctor ( Christopher Ecc ##leston ) in 2005 . He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s , but rejected by the production team at the time . Continuing the theme introduced with the series ' first five episodes , " The Snow ##men " was promoted like a movie . A movie poster was released in the Radio Times , showing the Doctor and Clara ascending the ladder to the TARDIS .
The episode saw several major design changes for the series . " The Snow ##men " is the debut of a redesigned TARDIS interior , as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune . The new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the Doctor ' s face , the first time since Survival , the final serial of the classic series in 1989 , that the Doctor ' s face has been seen in the title sequence . Moffat had noticed that the TARDIS ' design was getting " progressively whims ##ical " and resembled more of a " magical place " rather than a machine . It was designed by series production designer Michael Pick ##wood , who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be " darker and mood ##ier " and provide an easier access to the " gallery " of the ship when shooting .
The Doctor also wears a one @ - @ off costume , Victorian @ - @ themed , which Smith described as " a bit Art ##ful Dod ##ger meets the Doctor " . Moffat described the new outfit as a " progression " as the Doctor was in " a different phase of his life now " and felt more " grown @ - @ up " and father ##like . The costume was designed by Howard Bur ##den for this episode . " The Snow ##men " also contains several references to Sherlock Holmes , including the Doctor dressing up as him . Moffat is co @ - @ creator of the BBC series Sherlock , for which Smith auditioned for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor . In addition , the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the Sherlock theme .
= = = Casting = = =
This episode marks the return of Jenna @ - @ Louise Coleman , who previously appeared in the series opener , " Asylum of the Daleks " . Coleman was cast because of her chemistry with Matt Smith , and especially because she was able to talk faster than him . She auditioned for the role of Clara , not Os ##win from " Asylum " , as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to Moffat whilst casting for Clara . The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep Coleman ' s appearance a secret until " Asylum " was broadcast ; the effort was ultimately successful . Moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made " the show feel different " and brought the story to " a new beginning " with a different person meeting the Doctor . Smith said that Clara was different from her predecessor Amy Pond ( Karen Gillan ) , which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor . Coleman described her as resource ##ful and not intimidated , citing the reason for following the Doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers . The Clara who would become a travelling companion of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring premiere , " The Bells of Saint John " ; save for a brief cameo at the end of " The Snow ##men " . Coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with " trust that there would be a pay ##off " to her mystery .
Also returning to the series are Nev ##e McI ##nt ##osh as Madame V ##ast ##ra , Dan Stark ##ey as Stra ##x and Cat ##rin Stewart as Jenny . All three previously appeared in " A Good Man Goes to War " and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the pre ##qu ##els . They returned due to the popularity of V ##ast ##ra and Jenny ; Moffat considered a spin @ - @ off featuring them , though he did not have the time to do it . Instead , he decided to bring them back in the main series . Richard E . Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions , as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death , which was written by Moffat and as an alternative Ninth Doctor in the animated story Scream of the Sh ##alk ##a which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005 . Smith commented that Grant was " born to be a Who villain . He pitches it on that perfect level and tone " . Grant ' s appearance in Doctor Who was t ##eased by the BBC via Twitter , announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012 . Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script , and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme . The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian McK ##ellen . The two children Clara is govern ##ess to , Dig ##by and Frances ##ca , were played by real @ - @ life brother and sister Joseph and Ellie Dar ##cey @ - @ Ald ##en .
= = = Filming and effects = = =
" The Snow ##men " was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character ; however , it did not begin filming until the week of 6 August 2012 , after Coleman had worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing the Christmas special . The read @ - @ through had taken place on 2 August 2012 . This was the first Christmas special to be filmed in BBC Wales ' new Ro ##ath Lock studios . Scenes featuring Coleman and several guest stars in a Victorian setting were filmed in Newport , Wales , while Coleman and Smith were also spotted filming in Bristol two weeks later on 21 August . Some scenes which used snow props were filmed in Portland Square , Bristol , where filming took place overnight on 21 – 22 August 2012 . Bristol was chosen because it had Victorian @ - @ era architecture . Pick ##wood stated that his favourite set is the London Street with the back of the pub , which he said was based on a sixteenth @ - @ century building in Oxford . The locations were blocked off and sprayed with fake snow .
The TARDIS on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post @ - @ production special effects . Director Saul Metz ##stein explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look for the snow ##men ; the first ones he likened to Z ##ipp ##y from Rainbow which was too " cute " of an appearance , and so the effects team created more menacing CGI faces . Clara ' s introduction to the TARDIS introduced two novel effects for the show . The first was a single @ - @ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the TARDIS to its interior , with the impl ##ication of the TARDIS ' s trans @ - @ dimensional nature shown to the audience . In the following shot , the camera does a complete circle of the TARDIS console , an effect not seen since the early days of the show . Metz ##stein wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the " bigger on the inside than the outside " nature of the time machine .
In addition to the three prequel mini @ - @ episodes , the cast also filmed an additional promotional video , " Song ##tar ##an Carol ##s , " which the BBC uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast . The video featured Stark ##ey singing modified versions of several Christmas songs in character as Stra ##x as his cast ##mates look on , before everyone breaks character and begins laughing .

The episode received mostly positive reviews . Dan Martin of The Guardian called it " actually the best Christmas Special since ' The Christmas Invasion ' " and the first to be " actually scary " , with " everything we like " about Doctor Who and Christmas . He praised Coleman ' s introduction as Clara and the gang of V ##ast ##ra , Jenny , and Stra ##x . IGN ' s Matt Ris ##ley gave " The Snow ##men " a score of 9 @ . @ 4 out of 10 , describing it as " a roll ##icking , riv ##eting master ##class in storytelling " which " refreshing ##ly " lacked traditional Christmas references " in favour of some spark ##ling dialogue , gorgeous set design and fascinating characterisation " . While he felt that Grant and McK ##ellen were under ##used , he was very positive towards Coleman ' s " unpredictable " Clara . Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mul ##k ##ern was pleased with the return of the Great Intelligence despite an inconsist ##ency in the timeline he found , and praised the " lovely images " and direction of the special , though he felt the variation of the theme music " lacks the menace " of the original . While he was positive towards Clara , he was " unm ##oved by her death " as it was " plain ##ly silly " that she did not look injured .
Nick Set ##ch ##field of SF ##X gave the special four and a half out of five stars , writing that " the power of emotion saves the day again " was appropriate in light of the festivities and many fair ##yt ##ales referenced in the story . Set ##ch ##field was positive towards the " terrific " comedy with Stra ##x , Coleman and the " surprisingly under ##used " Grant , as well as the new title sequence and TARDIS . While he wrote that the subtle call ##back of the Great Intelligence was " a tad more interesting than the usual ' So , we meet again ! ' sch ##t ##ick " , he ultimately felt their threat " never quite comes into sharp relief " . Ne ##ela Deb ##n ##ath of The Independent wrote that " The Snow ##men " was stronger than the previous year ' s " The Doctor , the Widow , and the Ward ##robe " as it was connected to the overall story of the series , but " still has a way to go if it is to live up to ' A Christmas Carol ' " . Despite feeling that it was " enjoyable " , she noted that " the story feels truncated and rushed "
The Mirror ' s Jon Cooper also praised Coleman and the new side of the Doctor that was shown , comparing it to Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) challenging the Ninth Doctor ( Christopher Ecc ##leston ) . However , he felt the character @ - @ heavy story was to the detr ##iment of the plot , which was " a classic Who set @ - @ up that ultimately suffers from a lack of explanation [ and ] more set @ - @ pieces than a coherent whole " . He felt that the episode may not have been accessible for casual viewers , but offered much for fans in time for the programme ' s fif ##tieth anniversary . Dominic Cavendish of The Daily Telegraph gave " The Snow ##men " three out of five stars , disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been hyp ##ed to be . While he was positive towards Smith and the TARDIS on the cloud , he criticised Stra ##x and the " Sud ##oku @ - @ like complexity " of the script .
The episode was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ) , alongside " Asylum of the Daleks " and " The Angels Take Manhattan " , but lost to the Game of Th ##rones episode " Black ##water " .

= No . 20 Squadron RAAF =
No . 20 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) support squadron . Coming under the control of No . 96 Wing , it is responsible for the management of the airfield at RAAF Base W ##oom ##era , South Australia . The squadron originated as a maritime patrol unit during World War II . R ##aised in August 1941 , it operated PB ##Y Catal ##ina and Short Empire flying boats from bases in New Guinea , Queensland and the Northern Territory , conducting search @ - @ and @ - @ rescue , mine @ - @ laying , anti @ - @ submarine and bombing missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre . Following the conclusion of hostilities , the squadron was disbanded in March 1946 . It was reactivated as an airfield support squadron in April 2015 .

No . 20 Squadron was formed at Port Moresby , New Guinea , on 1 August 1941 for a general reconnaissance role , under the command of Squadron Leader W . N . Gibson . Its establishment was six PB ##Y Catal ##ina flying boats and 133 personnel , but only five aircraft ( all transferred from No . 11 Squadron ) and 55 personnel were available initially . The squadron conducted long @ - @ range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to Australia ' s north in conjunction with No . 11 Squadron . On 18 November , No . 20 Squadron ' s Catal ##inas were augmented by two Short Empire flying boats transferred from No . 11 Squadron .
On 25 November 1941 , following the loss of HMAS Sydney , one of No . 20 Squadron ' s Catal ##inas was despatched to Western Australia to join a No . 11 Squadron Catal ##ina in search @ - @ and @ - @ rescue missions , but they found only oil sl ##icks . By the outbreak of war in the Pacific , No . 20 Squadron had a strength of six Catal ##inas and two Empire flying boats . Its personnel at the beginning of December numbered 14 officers and 118 men . The squadron undertook its first sortie of the Pacific War on 8 December ; a Catal ##ina located three Japanese l ##ug ##gers in the vicinity of Thursday Island , Queensland . Later in the month it commenced anti @ - @ submarine patrols and , in January 1942 , bombing raids against Japanese bases . As the Japanese advanced into the South West Pacific , No . 20 Squadron was also responsible for evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion . On 21 January , one of its Catal ##inas located the Japanese fleet steaming for Rabaul and signalled a warning to the town ' s Australian defenders before being shot down by anti @ - @ aircraft fire ; it was the squadron ' s first combat loss .
In the wake of the fall of Rabaul , the Catal ##inas of Nos . 11 and 20 Squadrons became the RAAF ' s only offensive weapon against the Japanese . Their raids on Rabaul did little to stem the Japanese advance , and in the following months Port Moresby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks , which destroyed aircraft , facilities , and squadron records . In February 1942 , the Short Empires operated by Nos . 11 and 20 Squadrons were transferred to the newly formed No . 33 ( Transport ) Squadron . No . 20 Squadron lost two Catal ##inas during patrols on 4 and 6 May ; the nine crewmen of the first were later found to have been captured and beheaded ; the crew of the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace .
In response to the threat of invasion at Port Moresby , Nos . 11 and 20 Squadrons moved to Bowen , Queensland , on 7 May 1942 . They were soon attacking Japanese targets in Lae , Salam ##aua and Rabaul . On 27 June , each squadron contributed an aircraft to a four @ - @ hour raid over Lae and Salam ##aua during which , as well as bombs , the RAAF crews dropped beer bottles to disrupt the enemy soldiers ' sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was , according to the official history , " something between a shr ##ill whistle and a scream " . By 1 July , No . 20 Squadron ' s strength was six Catal ##inas and 175 personnel , out of a planned establishment of nine aircraft and 415 personnel . Its prime responsibility in early 1942 was maritime reconnaissance as far as New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , and New Caledonia ; the latter half of the year saw a greater focus on night bombing . Now comprising 252 officers and men , the squadron relocated to Cairns on 11 November 1942 . From Cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance , anti @ - @ submarine and occasional bombing operations over the waters around New Guinea . Between December 1942 and March 1943 , No . 20 Squadron ' s aircraft flew a total of 9 @ , @ 62 ##9 hours and dropped 227 tons of bombs . The squadron ' s role changed in June 1943 when it commenced mine @ - @ laying operations over the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines , though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops .
In September 1944 , No . 20 Squadron became part of No . 76 Wing RAAF , along with Nos . 42 and 43 Squadrons , and moved to Darwin , Northern Territory . All three squadrons operated Catal ##inas , their primary purpose being mine @ - @ laying . On the night of 30 September , a Catal ##ina of No . 20 Squadron was shot down while attacking a ship at Pom ##ela ##a in the Dutch East Indies ; the loss was compounded by the fact that one of the coordin ##ators of the mining campaign , Lieutenant Commander P . E . Carr of the Royal Australian Navy , was aboard the plane and was captured by the Japanese . Another of the squadron ' s Catal ##inas went down on the night of 27 / 28 January 1945 , possibly in a cyclone over the Timor Sea , during the campaign to mine Sur ##ab ##aya . In March , a detachment of four No . 20 Squadron aircraft , along with four from No . 43 Squadron , laid mines off the coast of southern China and Form ##ossa as part of a No . 76 Wing offensive in this area ; these operations were conducted from Leyte Gulf in the Philippines . One of No . 20 Squadron ' s Catal ##inas was lost on the night of 7 / 8 March , most likely owing to bad weather rather than enemy action . Three of the squadron ' s aircraft mined the entrance to Hong Kong harbour on 8 April and , on 26 May , four of its Catal ##inas mined W ##ench ##ow harbour in China , the furthest north that any Australian aircraft infiltrated during the war in the Pacific . Three of its aircraft flew the RAAF ' s last mine @ - @ laying mission on 30 July .
No . 20 Squadron ' s final wartime sortie was a patrol on 14 August 1945 . Following the end of the war , the squadron operated in the transport role and fer ##ried Australian prisoners of war home from various locations in South East Asia . It relocated to RAAF Station Rath ##m ##ines , New South Wales , on 21 November . No . 20 Squadron flew its last mission , a transport flight to Bal ##ik ##p ##apan , on 21 January 1946 , and disbanded at Rath ##m ##ines on 27 March .

No . 20 Squadron was reactivated on 1 April 2015 to support airfield operations at RAAF Base W ##oom ##era , South Australia . Cons ##isting of nine uniform ##ed personnel and one Australian Public Service member under the command of Squadron Leader Simon Bartlett , the squadron formed part of No . 96 Wing , a component of Combat Support Group ( CS ##G ) .

= Light Tank Mk VII Tetr ##arch =
The Light Tank Mk VII ( A ##17 ) , also known as the Tetr ##arch , was a British light tank produced by Vickers @ - @ Armstrong ##s in the late 1930s and deployed during the World War II . The Tetr ##arch was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army . It improved upon its predecessor , the Mk VI ##B Light Tank , by introducing the extra firepower of a 2 @ - @ pounder gun . The War Office ordered 70 tanks , an order that eventually increased to 220 . Production was delayed by several factors , and as a consequence , only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced .
The tank ' s design flaws , combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions , ruled out the use of Tetr ##archs in the North African Campaign . As a result , the majority of the tanks remained in Britain , although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the L ##end @ - @ L ##ease program . In early 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations , one of which was equipped with Tetr ##archs . In May 1942 , a small number of Tetr ##archs formed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar , and , in June 1942 , Tetr ##archs were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @ - @ portable light tank to support British airborne forces . The Tetr ##archs were transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft Ham ##il ##car gliders . A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 ; instead they were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment .
The division used approximately 20 Tetr ##archs during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944 . The tanks were successfully landed by glider , but they did not perform well . Several were lost in accidents , and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces . A few days after the beginning of the operation , the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support . By August 1944 , most of the Tetr ##archs in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks , and the remainder were replaced by the M2 ##2 Locust in December 1944 .
Tetr ##archs did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946 ; the last was retired in 1950 . There were several variations on the Tetr ##arch design , including the Al ##ect ##o self @ - @ propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII , but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army .
= = Development history = =
= = = Initial development = = =
The prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII ( A ##17 ) , nicknamed ' Purd ##ah ' , was first developed in 1937 by Vickers @ - @ Armstrong ##s as a private venture , and was intended to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign militar ##ies . It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company . The tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns . Vickers @ - @ Armstrong installed on the Mk VII ##s a 2 @ - @ pounder 40 @ - @ millimetre ( 1 @ . @ 6 in ) main gun paired with a 7 @ . @ 92 @ - @ millimetre ( 0 @ . @ 312 in ) Bes ##a machine gun , and mounted the two guns in a two @ - @ man turret . The tank possessed a maximum of 14 millimetres ( 0 @ . @ 55 in ) of armour . The prototype weighed approximately 16 @ , @ 800 pounds ( 7 @ , @ 600 kg ) and was powered by a 165 @ - @ horsepower ( 123 kW ) Meadows engine . Susp ##ension was on eight road wheels , four per side , with no separate driver or id ##ler wheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) top speed . The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models . The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks . For shar ##per turns , the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank ; the dual system of turning was designed to less ##en mechanical strain on the Mk ##V ##II and reduce its power was ##tage . The suspension system was also a new design that relied on str ##uts with pockets of air for spring ##ing and cush ##ions of oil for damp ##ing , and each of the wheels was independently spr ##ung .
The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the model was tested as a possible " light cruiser " since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the N ##uff ##ield A ##13 offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . Despite this , it was decided that it was essential for some Tetr ##archs to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program . Accordingly , the War Office gave the Tetr ##arch the official General Staff specification number A ##17 , and , in November 1938 , accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank ' s range .
= = = Production = = =
The number to be produced was subject to fluct ##uation as the War Office vac ##ill ##ated in their demand ; in July 1938 , it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced , then increased the request to 120 after a three @ - @ day conference in November . Production was to begin in July 1940 , but meanwhile the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100 . The number further increased to 220 after Metropolitan C ##amm ##ell Car ##riage and W ##agon , a company part owned by Vickers @ - @ Armstrong that would be producing the tanks , indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks .
Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a post @ - @ Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle . Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re @ - @ evaluate the suit ##ability of the light tank design . The pre @ - @ war role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @ - @ country abilities . Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled .
The cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk VII ##s ; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177 . The name ' Tetr ##arch ' was given to the Mk VII , on 22 September 1941 , on the orders of the War Office . The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year .
= = = Transfer to airborne role = = =
The War Office and the Army were concluding , at this point , that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat , and the Tetr ##arch was considered to be obsolete . This decision may have marked the end for the Tetr ##arch in active service ; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat .
The demise of Tetr ##arch was prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid @ - @ 1941 , as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain ' s fledgling airborne forces , formed in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill . When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces , officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an integral component ; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment , which , by 1941 , was to include artillery and some form of tank . Plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions , but , by May 1941 , the feasibility of a 5 @ . @ 5 metric tons ( 5 @ . @ 4 long tons ) tank to be carried for 350 miles ( 560 km ) in a glider was accepted , although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task . In a conference held on 16 January 1941 , it was decided that the General Aircraft Ham ##il ##car , currently under development , would be used to transport a single Tetr ##arch tank or two Universal Car ##riers . The Tetr ##arch was chosen because it was an obsolete design , and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces .
Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying the Tetr ##archs and their crews inside Ham ##il ##car gliders . These exercises were successful ; during the training by ' C ' Squadron of the Gl ##ider Pilot Regiment , which specialised in flying the Ham ##il ##cars , over 2 @ , @ 800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew . Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries , with seven pilots killed during the training . When the Tetr ##arch was re @ - @ designated as an airborne tank , several changes were made to its design . A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a 76 @ . @ 2 @ - @ millimetre ( 3 @ . @ 00 in ) infantry support howitzer ; these tanks were then designated as Tetr ##arch 1 CS ( Close Support ) . Additionally , Little ##john adapt ##ors were added to those Tetr ##archs which still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration .
The Tetr ##arch experienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the Army and airborne forces . One of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942 , which particularly affected the airborne forces . The transport of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under the L ##end @ - @ L ##ease Act depleted the number available for use by airborne forces , as did the loss of several more during Operation Iron ##cl ##ad , the invasion of Madagascar . A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that approximately 50 Tetr ##archs were available for use . In a memorandum , dated January 1943 , by Major General George F . Hop ##kinson , commander of the 1st Airborne Division , Hop ##kinson complained that he had been informed that 70 of the tanks were available , whereas only 50 actually remained , with no reserves to replace those lost in combat . This lack of sufficient replacement reserves , combined with a War Office report that some 287 airborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India , led to the Tetr ##arch ' s eventual replacement by the US M2 ##2 Locust .
= = Performance = =
A number of design faults of the Tetr ##arch were revealed through its operational use . Its size limited the possible crew to three , a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetr ##arch effectively . The gunner or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act as load ##er for the 2 pounder , which caused delays in combat . A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of Tetr ##archs during combat would be almost impossible .
Problems were also found with the Little ##john adapt ##or fitted to the 2 @ - @ pounder to increase its range and penetration power ; after they had been fitted the adap ##ters could not be removed , and could only fire specially designed armour @ - @ piercing rounds , which took time to manufacture .
The War Office also considered the Tetr ##arch ' s cooling system faulty , making the tank unsuitable for service in hot ##ter climates , such as the Middle East and North Africa .

= = = L ##end @ - @ lease = = =
The first Tetr ##archs were delivered to the Army in November 1940 , and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division ( which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France ) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division . However , the faults discovered with the Tetr ##arch cooling system prec ##luded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign . Shortly after , all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service .
The Tetr ##archs remained in Britain , and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service , but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR , Operation Barbarossa began , and the USSR became an ally of Britain . The L ##end @ - @ L ##ease program , begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China , was therefore extended to the USSR . As part of the program , the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR , which in early 1942 , included a shipment of 20 Tetr ##archs , as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks . The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British , and so could use the Tetr ##archs . When the tanks arrived in the USSR , however , it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions ; additionally , the cold weather had a del ##eter ##ious effect on the tank ' s suspension and tracks . Additional testing of the Tetr ##archs was conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its controll ##ability , manoeuv ##r ##ability , and speed , as well its ability to run on low @ - @ quality fuel , unlike contemporary Soviet designs . The thin ##ness of the Tetr ##arch ' s armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved , as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank ' s speed . Despite these draw ##backs in the Tetr ##arch ' s design , Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T @ - @ 70 light tank in use at the time , and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat . A number of Tetr ##archs were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle , and in September 1943 two were assigned to the 132 ##nd Separ ##ated Tank Battalion , which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade ; both tanks were destroyed in combat , one on 30 September and the other on 2 October , the latter a casualty of artillery fire . Several were also used for propaganda purposes , appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the Caucasus region .
= = = Operation Iron ##cl ##ad = = =
In mid @ - @ 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations , known as ' A ' , ' B ' and ' C ' Special Service Squadrons . Both ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark VI ##c light tanks , but ' C ' Squadron was equipped with twelve Tetr ##archs transferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade , 1st Armoured Division . On 31 July 1941 , ' C ' Squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate . All three squadrons were transported to Inver ##ary in Scotland for intensive training that focused on embark ##ation and disembark ##ation from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations . In early September , elements of ' C ' Squadron , including six Tetr ##archs , formed part of a force which sailed for Freet ##own in West Africa ; during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany , and the force was read ##ied to capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred . These fears proved ground ##less , and in March 1942 , the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training .
The next assignment , Operation Iron ##cl ##ad , was the invasion of Madagascar , the third largest island in the world and then under Vichy French control . The Prime Minister and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port of An ##ts ##ir ##ane to Japanese naval forces , which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean . Operation Iron ##cl ##ad was under the command of Major General Robert G . Stur ##ges and consisted of No . 5 Commando , 29th Independent Brigade Group , and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th Infantry Division . The 29th Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations , and under its command was ' B ' Special Service Squadron , created by amalgam ##ating six Valent ##ines from ' B ' Squadron and six Tetr ##archs from ' C ' Squadron into a single unit . The squadron was formed into four troops , one Headquarters troop of three Valent ##ines and one Tetr ##arch , one of four Valent ##ines , and two formed from the remaining five Tetr ##archs . The invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of Madagascar on 4 May , near An ##ts ##ir ##ane and the bay of Diego Su ##arez . The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip , which would allow the British forces to advance approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) and approach An ##ts ##ir ##ane from the rear . Information about the landing beaches , the defences possessed by the port , and the Vichy French defending forces was limited and vague , although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a Valentine tank .
The landings began at 04 : 30 on 5 May , with 5 Commando landing at Cour ##rier Bay and the three infantry brigades and ' B ' Squadron landing at Am ##bar ##ar ##ata Bay . The objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control of An ##ts ##ir ##ane and a nearby town , but although the infantry landed successfully , ' B ' Squadron had more trouble ; the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after a Tetr ##arch came loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand . The infantry brigades advanced toward An ##ts ##ir ##ane without the squadron , but eventually two Valent ##ines and a single Tetr ##arch were dispatched in support , catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of An ##am ##ak ##ia . Here the invasion force encountered the first French defences , consisting of camoufl ##aged trenches and pill ##boxes dug in along a ridge . The tanks attempted to breach them , but the rocky ground made manoeuv ##ring difficult and they could not close with the pill ##boxes and trenches ; they engaged a number of targets with 2 pounder and machine @ - @ gun fire , but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day . The tanks were ordered to outfl ##ank the defences and advance further into the island , and they were soon joined by two other Tetr ##archs dispatched from the beaches ; the small force continued to advance until it encountered the Vichy French main line of defence . This had been built prior to the First World War and included camoufl ##aged pill ##boxes , machine @ - @ gun nests and dug @ - @ in 75 mm artillery pieces ; the latter , although not specifically designed for an anti @ - @ tank role , could penetrate the armour of both the Tetr ##archs and the Valent ##ines . The two Valent ##ines advanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire , and two Tetr ##archs that were moving behind them suffered the same fate ; the third Tetr ##arch retreated in order to report on the French resistance , machine gun ##ning a motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back .
The commander of the Tetr ##arch made his report , and was then ordered to take command of four Valent ##ines and two Tetr ##archs which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the French defences . The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out @ - @ flank the line by advancing from the right @ - @ hand side , using several hills as cover ; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one Valentine and one Tetr ##arch were hit and destroyed . The remaining tanks exchanged several volley ##s of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions . The French line was eventually broken by 29th Brigade , aided by an amphibious assault by Royal Marines ; the remaining tanks of ' B ' Squadron , two Valent ##ines and three Tetr ##archs , remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May , coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another Valentine . The squadron played no further part in the battle , as the Vichy French authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day , although French troops would continue to engage the British occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late November . ' C ' Squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion ; only one Valentine and three Tetr ##archs out of twelve tanks were functional by 7 May , and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded . It remained in Madagascar until early 1943 , when it was shipped to India and took part in the Burma Campaign as part of 29th Brigade .

Because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid @ - @ 1940 , when the British airborne establishment was formed , the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops . Progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation , Operation Coloss ##us , was conducted by a ret ##rained Commando unit . By 1942 , there existed specifically trained airborne units , including the 1st Airborne Division , and on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division . This unit , designated the Light Tank Squadron , was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division , using their tanks ' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units . The obvious unit for conversion was ' C ' Special Services Squadron , as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and , more importantly , was the only unit that was still using Tetr ##archs ; it had been re @ - @ designated as an airborne tank by the War Office . ' C ' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942 , bringing with it seven Tetr ##archs among its other vehicles . The unit immediately began training , but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long ; during mid @ - @ 1943 , the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily . ' C ' Squadron remained in Britain , as not enough Ham ##il ##car gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its Tetr ##archs ; the squadron was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division , which had been raised in April 1943 , and ' C ' Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict . The squadron continued to train as an air @ - @ portable unit , and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties , including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter @ - @ attacking enemy infantry and armour .
On 13 December 1943 , the War Office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars , and on 1 April 1944 , it was re @ - @ designated as the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment . The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron , a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron ; two Tetr ##archs , the Mark 1 CS variation , were attached to the Headquarters Squadron , but the Light Tank Squadron , also known as ' A ' Squadron , received the majority of the Tetr ##archs . ' A ' Squadron had approximately nineteen Tetr ##archs split between six troops , two of which were of the CS variation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with Little ##john adapt ##ors . On 24 May 1944 , after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres , ' A ' Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at Tarr ##ant Rush ##ton airfield , while the rest of the regiment moved to RAF Bri ##ze Norton airfield the next day ; from these two airfields , the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy . The operation began on the night of 5 June , with the deployment of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy . It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seab ##orne landings , securing strategically important areas east of Caen , capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River D ##ives , and destroying a coastal artillery battery . Ins ##uff ##icient transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division ' s brigades simultaneously ; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day . Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6th Airlanding Brigade , to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached , to be landed first ; however , aerial photography revealed that anti @ - @ glider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade . Therefore , Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade ( which did not util ##ise gliders ) should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones , allowing the 6th Airlanding Brigade to land in the second lift .
The Hors ##a and Ham ##il ##car gliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of obstruct ##ions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and imp ##ede the movement of German forces attempting to counter @ - @ attack . The Tetr ##archs of ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron ' s strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetr ##arch broke loose of its sh ##ack ##les and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea mid @ - @ flight . The squadron ' s strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and the Tetr ##archs they carried ; a third Ham ##il ##car hit another Tetr ##arch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unus ##able , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily imm ##obile when parachute rigging lines became tang ##led in their susp ##ensions , forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding tor ##ches .
The squadron retrieved all of the remaining Tetr ##archs and advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment ; there , they received orders to support the 8th Parachute Battalion in the Bois de Bav ##ent area and conduct reconnaissance duties . After linking with the battalion , the squadron began reconn ##oit ##ring , and engaged German infantry and armour they encountered . By the end of 7 June , two Tetr ##archs had been lost to enemy action , one destroyed by a German self @ - @ propelled gun and the second by hitting a mine . The division was reinforced by British troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy , while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties . At this time , Gale decided to avoid , when possible , engaging the Tetr ##archs with German armour , as they proved to be completely out ##cl ##assed by the German tanks and self @ - @ propelled guns , such as the Panzer IV and the Stur ##m ##ges ##ch ##ü ##tz III . Instead , when the division required armoured support , it summoned it from armoured units outside the division , and the Tetr ##archs were used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support . By August , in the division ' s preparation for the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead , the majority of Tetr ##archs in ' A ' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks ; only three Tetr ##archs remained , assigned to the Headquarters troop of ' A ' Squadron .

Operation Tonga was the last that Tetr ##archs saw of active combat . During the first week of October 1944 , the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive reorganization , in which it was completely restruct ##ured , and all the remaining Tetr ##archs were retired . They were replaced with the M2 ##2 Locust , a purpose @ - @ built airborne light tank of American design ; eight Locust ##s were used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation Varsity , the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine . A report issued by the Director ( Air ) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Tetr ##arch design was considered obsolete , and any light tanks used in post @ - @ war airborne formations would be entirely new in design . A small number of Tetr ##archs remained in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949 ; a Ham ##il ##car glider flight was stationed at RAF Fair ##ford , and a troop of Tetr ##archs was kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders . However , glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and the Tetr ##archs withdrawn from service .
= = Varian ##ts = =
There were several variants of the Tetr ##arch design . The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII , Vickers @ - @ Armstrong ' s proposed successor to the Tetr ##arch . The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry Hopkins , named after President Roosevelt ' s chief diplomatic advisor , and was given the General Staff design number A ##25 by the War Office . The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the Tetr ##arch in a number of areas . It had thicker armour than the Tetr ##arch , with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of 38 millimetres ( 1 @ . @ 5 in ) and the side armour to 17 millimetres ( 0 @ . @ 67 in ) , and the turret and hull given more sl ##oped surfaces to help defl ##ect shells fired at the tank . The dimensions of the Tetr ##arch were also changed ; the Mark VIII was longer by 6 inches ( 0 @ . @ 15 m ) , wider by 1 foot 3 inches ( 0 @ . @ 38 m ) and heavier . The new tank was no longer air @ - @ portable , as it was too heavy to be carried by a Ham ##il ##car . The 12 @ - @ cylinder engine of the Tetr ##arch was fitted to the Mark VIII , although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) ; its armament also remained the same as that of the Tetr ##arch . The War Office authorised the construction of three prototype models in April 1941 . The new design was considered a success , and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1 @ , @ 000 to be constructed in September . However , problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes , and a report issued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems . These problems continued to persist into 1943 , when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service ; approximately 100 Mark VIII ##s were produced by 1945 , when production ended .
A second variant on the Tetr ##arch design was the Tetr ##arch Dup ##lex Drive ( " Tetr ##arch DD " ) . The Dup ##lex Drive system was invented by Nicholas Strauss ##ler , and was designed to allow a tank to ' swim ' through water and participate in amphibious operations . The system functioned by erect ##ing a large water ##proof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks , which was supported by thirty @ - @ six infl ##atable tubes and steel str ##uts ; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float , and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank ' s engine . The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land . The system was fitted during June 1941 , as the Tetr ##arch was the light ##est light tank available at the time ; the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs , allowing the Dup ##lex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks , such as the Valentine . The system would be used during Operation Overlord , when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches .

The game was released in Europe in 1991 , in North America on December 19 , 1991 and in Japan on December 20 , 1991 . Qu ##ack ##S ##hot stars Donald Duck and his three nephews , Huey , Dewey , and Lou ##ie , as treasure @ - @ hunters , and is part of a series of games published by Sega that were based on Walt Disney cartoon characters .
Qu ##ack ##S ##hot was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists . The game was universally lauded for its graphics , with magazines like Sega Pro describing them as " some of the best graphics around . " The game was also praised for its music and puzzles , as well as their clever use in the game . However , Qu ##ack ##S ##hot was criticized for its controls , being described by IGN as " float @ - @ y " and making certain segments of the game unnecess ##arily difficult . The game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples , which several other Genesis games of the time had .
= = Gameplay = =
The player , as Donald , ventures through a variety of side @ - @ scrolling levels . Generally , each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon , such as the Mahar ##ajah ' s palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides . Although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections , various obstacles prevent the player from entering the dungeons outside of a specific order . In addition to this , some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections . Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area , he may leave by calling his nephews ' bipl ##ane , and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return .
Donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot plung ##ers , pop ##corn or bubble gum . Donald has unlimited plung ##ers which can only temporarily stun enemies ( though bosses can still be damaged with plung ##ers ) , and can collect pop ##corn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gy ##ro Gear ##lo ##ose . Later in the game , the plung ##er is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and , when stuck to a passing bird , allows Donald to traverse longer distances . In Duck ##burg , India and Egypt , Donald can also pick up ch ##ili pe ##ppers which increase his temper , eventually temporarily allowing him to become inv ##inc ##ible , increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path .
= = Plot = =
While Donald is fl ##ipping through some books in Sc ##ro ##o ##ge McD ##uck ' s library , a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of King Gar ##uz ##ia , ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom in ancient times . The map leads to the location of the king ' s most prized possession , hidden in a secret place shortly before his death . Donald thinks this is his path to ric ##hes . Unfortunately Big Bad Pete over ##hears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure .
Te ##amed with his nephews Huey , Dewey , and Lou ##ie , and using the partial map from the library , Donald begins his search in Duck ##burg , with the trail being directed to an Aztec pyramid in Mexico . Outside the pyramid , he is directed by a " sweet senior ##ita " to obtain a " hero key " from an explorer back in Duck ##burg to open the pyramid . Inside the pyramid , Donald meets G ##oof ##y , who gives him a strange note and a plung ##er to help him reach higher places , and tells him that Gy ##ro Gear ##lo ##ose is looking for him back in Duck ##burg . Trav ##elling across the rooft ##ops of Duck ##burg to meet Gy ##ro , Donald is given Gy ##ro ' s latest invention , bubble ##gum am ##mo that can break through walls . The last location on the partial map is Count Dracula ' s castle in Transylvania , where Donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the Count carries the real treasure map .
After defeating Dracula , Donald receives a more complete map . In India , Donald enters the palace of the Mahar ##ajah , where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her garden in exchange for a S ##phin ##x T ##ear . Donald succeeds and receives the S ##phin ##x T ##ear , which is the key to open a temple in Egypt . Donald is able to solve the " R ##iddle of the S ##phin ##x " using the note G ##oof ##y had given him , and obtains the S ##ce ##p ##ter of Ra before escaping in a mine cart . From there , he journeys to the South Pole , where he finds a key frozen in ice , and uses the S ##ce ##p ##ter of Ra to melt the ice and grab the key . The key unl ##ocks the hold of a Viking ship , which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure . The ship is haunted by ghosts , and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them . After defeating a skeletal Viking warrior , Donald returns to the deck , where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the South Pole , and gives him an " ancient Viking plung ##er " that att ##aches to flying creatures . Donald then returns to the South Pole , hit ##ching a ride on one of Pete ' s bird min ##ions to reach the diary .
However , upon finding the diary , Pete shows up , holding Donald ' s nephews hostage in exchange for the diary . After giving Pete the diary , Donald travels to Pete ' s hide ##out to defeat Pete and get the diary back . The diary reveals that the map , when d ##ipped in water , will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure . Donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault . After defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure , Donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue . When the disappointed Donald returns home , Huey , Dewey and Lou ##ie accidentally break the statue , which reveals a golden jew ##eled necklace was hidden inside . Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together .

= Olm ##ec colossal heads =
The Olm ##ec colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olm ##ec civilization of ancient Mesoamer ##ica . All portray mature men with fles ##hy cheeks , flat n ##oses , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tab ##asco and Veracruz . The backs of the monuments often are flat . The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los T ##ux ##t ##las mountains of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances , requiring a great deal of human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olm ##ec rulers . Each of the known examples has a distinctive head ##dress . The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olm ##ec centres , but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear .
The discovery of a colossal head at Tres Zap ##otes in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olm ##ec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938 . Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olm ##ec heart ##land on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Ten ##och ##t ##it ##l ##án were re @ - @ carved from massive stone th ##rones . An additional monument , at Tak ##al ##ik Ab ##aj in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example from outside the Olm ##ec heart ##land .
D ##ating the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation . Most have been dated to the Early Preclassic period ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) with some to the Middle Preclassic ( 1000 – 400 BC ) period . The smallest weigh 6 tons , while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons , although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone .
= = Olm ##ec civilization = =
The Olm ##ec civilization developed in the lowlands of southeastern Mexico between 1500 and 400 BC . The Olm ##ec heart ##land lies on the Gulf Coast of Mexico within the states of Veracruz and Tab ##asco , an area measuring approximately 275 kilometres ( 171 mi ) east to west and extending about 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) inland from the coast . The Olm ##ecs are regarded as the first civilization to develop in Mesoamer ##ica and the Olm ##ec heart ##land is one of six cr ##ad ##les of civilization worldwide , the others being the Norte Chico culture of South America , the Er ##lit ##ou culture of China ' s Yellow River , the Ind ##us Valley Civilization of south Asia , the civilization of ancient Egypt and the Sum ##erian civilization of ancient Iraq . Of these , only the Olm ##ec civilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting .
The Olm ##ecs were the first inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities . They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture . In the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of Olm ##ec writing , with the earliest examples of Olm ##ec hieroglyph ##s dating to around 650 BC . Examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts ; the texts are short and have been partially decipher ##ed based on their similarity to other Mesoamer ##ican scripts . The evidence of complex society developing in the Olm ##ec heart ##land has led to the Olm ##ecs being regarded as the " Mother Culture " of Mesoamer ##ica , although this concept remains controversial .
Some of the Olm ##ecs ' rulers seem to have served religious functions . The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by La Vent ##a in about 900 BC , with Tres Zap ##otes and Laguna de los Cer ##ros possibly sharing the role ; other urban centres were much less significant . The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear . Very fine Olm ##ec art , much clearly made for an elite , survives in several forms , notably Olm ##ec figurines , and larger sculptures such as The Wrest ##ler . The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population . Together with these , of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the " Olm ##ec @ - @ style masks " in stone , so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of an Olm ##ec context . These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads . Two thirds of Olm ##ec monumental sculpture represents the human form , and the colossal heads fall within this major theme of Olm ##ec art .
= = D ##ating = =
The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated . However , the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900 BC , indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still . The heads from Tres Zap ##otes had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La Vent ##a were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface . The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown , as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium . Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years . The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest , and are the most skill ##fully executed . All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamer ##ican chronology , generally to the Early Preclassic ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) , although the two Tres Zap ##otes heads and the La Cob ##ata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic ( 1000 – 400 BC ) .
= = Characteristics = =
Olm ##ec colossal heads vary in height from 1 @ . @ 47 to 3 @ . @ 4 metres ( 4 @ . @ 8 to 11 @ . @ 2 ft ) and weigh between 6 and 50 tons . All of the Olm ##ec colossal heads depict mature men with flat n ##oses and fles ##hy cheeks ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed . The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in the Olm ##ec region in modern times . The backs of the heads are often flat , as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall . All examples of Olm ##ec colossal heads wear distinctive head ##d ##resses that probably represent cloth or animal hide originals . Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head , and some are decorated with feathers . A head from La Vent ##a is decorated with the head of a bird . There are similarities between the head ##d ##resses on some of the heads that has led to speculation that specific head ##d ##resses may represent different dynasties , or perhaps identify specific rulers . Most of the heads wear large ear ##sp ##ool ##s inserted into the ear lobes .
All of the heads are realistic , un ##ide ##al ##ised and frank descriptions of the men . It is likely that they were portraits of living ( or recently deceased ) rulers well known to the sculpt ##ors . Each head is distinct and natural ##istic , displaying individual ##ised features . They were once thought to represent ball ##play ##ers although this theory is no longer widely held ; it is possible , however , that they represent rulers equipped for the Mesoamer ##ican ball ##game . Fac ##ial expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through plac ##id to smiling . The most natural ##istic Olm ##ec art is the earliest , appearing suddenly without surviving ant ##ec ##ed ##ents , with a tendency towards more styl ##ised sculpture as time progressed . Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El Man ##at ##í demonstrate that the Olm ##ecs are likely to have created many more per ##ish ##able sculptures than works sculpted from stone .
In the late nineteenth century , José Mel ##gar y Ser ##r ##ano described a colossal head as having " Ethiopian " features and spec ##ulations that the Olm ##ec had African origins resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso Med ##ell ##ín Zen ##il and in the 1970s in the writings of Ivan van S ##ert ##ima . Such speculation is not taken seriously by Mesoamer ##ican scholars such as Richard Die ##hl and Ann Cyp ##hers .
Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar , there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution . One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint , suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated . Heads did not just represent individual Olm ##ec rulers ; they also incorporated the very concept of rul ##ership itself .
= = Manufact ##ure = =
The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned , given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more powerful Olm ##ec rulers were able to mobil ##ise such resources . The workforce would have included sculpt ##ors , labourers , overs ##e ##ers , boat ##men , woodwork ##ers and other art ##es ##ans producing the tools to make and move the monument , in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers . The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end .
Archaeological investigation of Olm ##ec basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small fl ##akes of stone . The sculpture was then refined by ret ##ou ##ching the surface using hammer ##stones , which were generally rounded cob ##bles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . Ab ##ras ##ives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . Olm ##ec colossal heads were fashioned as in @ - @ the @ - @ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the ear ##sp ##ool ##s and head ##d ##resses . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @ - @ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed .
All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the Olm ##ec heart ##land were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los T ##ux ##t ##las mountains of Veracruz . Most were formed from coarse gr ##ained dark grey basalt known as Cerro C ##int ##epec basalt after a volcano in the range . Investig ##ators have proposed that large Cerro C ##int ##epec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments . These boulders are found in an area affected by large l ##ah ##ars ( volcanic mudslides ) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes , which suggests that the Olm ##ecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpt ##ing the heads . Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head . The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Vent ##a heads was transported a considerable distance from the source . The La Cob ##ata head was found on El Vig ##ia hill in the Sierra de los T ##ux ##t ##las and the stone from Tres Zap ##otes Coloss ##al Head 1 and Nest ##ep ##e Coloss ##al Head 1 ( also known as Tres Zap ##otes Monuments A and Q ) came from the same hill .
The boulders were transported over 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the source of the stone . The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown , especially since the Olm ##ecs lacked be ##asts of burden and functional wheels , and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible . Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river est ##uaries might have made the water ##borne transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical . Two badly damaged Olm ##ec sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes . A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . These sculptures may well depict Olm ##ec rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments . When transport over land was necessary , the Olm ##ecs are likely to have used caus ##eways , ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads . The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and flood ##pl ##ains ; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing und ##ulating hill country . The construction of temporary caus ##eways using the suitable and plentiful flood ##plain soils would have allowed a direct route across the flood ##pl ##ains to the San Lorenzo Plateau . Earth structures such as mounds , platforms and caus ##eways upon the plateau demonstrate that the Olm ##ec possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @ - @ scale earthworks .
The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental th ##rones from which they were reworked . Only four of the seventeen heart ##land heads do not have flattened backs , indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments . Alternatively , the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport , providing a stable form for hauling the monuments with ropes . Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental Olm ##ec th ##rones and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments .

Seventeen confirmed examples are known . An additional monument , at Tak ##al ##ik Ab ##aj in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example outside of the Olm ##ec heart ##land on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Possible fragments of additional colossal heads have been recovered at San Lorenzo and at San Fernando in Tab ##asco . Cr ##ude colossal stone heads are also known in the Southern Maya area where they are associated with the pot ##belly style of sculpture . Although some arguments have been made that they are pre @ - @ Olm ##ec , these latter monuments are generally believed to be influenced by the Olm ##ec style of sculpture .
= = = San Lorenzo = = =
The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north @ - @ south across the site . Although some were recovered from rav ##ines , they were found close to their original pl ##acements and had been buried by local erosion . These heads , together with a number of monumental stone th ##rones , probably formed a proc ##essional route across the site , powerful ##ly displaying its dynastic history . Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re @ - @ carved from older th ##rones .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 1 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 1 ) was lying facing upwards when excavated . The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of the Olm ##ec site . Coloss ##al Head 1 is 2 @ . @ 84 metres ( 9 @ . @ 3 ft ) high ; it measures 2 @ . @ 11 metres ( 6 @ . @ 9 ft ) wide and it weighs 25 @ . @ 3 tons . The monument was discovered partially buried at the edge of a g ##ully by Matthew Stirling in 1945 . When discovered it was lying on its back , looking upwards . It was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines . The majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 BC ; some pieces have been dated to the Villa Alta phase ( Late Classic period , 800 – 1000 AD ) . The head ##dress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head . The upper portion of the head ##dress is decorated with a U @ - @ shaped motif . This element descends across the front of the head ##dress , terminating on the forehead . On the front portion it is decorated with five semicirc ##ular motifs . The scal ##p piece does not meet the horizontal band , leaving a space between the two pieces . On each side of the face a str ##ap descends from the head ##dress and passes in front of the ear . The forehead is wr ##ink ##led in a f ##rown . The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth . The cheeks are pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed . The face is slightly asymmet ##ric , which may be due to error on the part of the sculpt ##ors or may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait ' s subject . The head has been moved to the Mus ##eo de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía de X ##al ##apa ( " Anthrop ##ological Museum of X ##al ##apa " ) .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 2 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 2 ) was reworked from a monumental throne . The head stands 2 @ . @ 69 metres ( 8 @ . @ 8 ft ) high and measures 1 @ . @ 83 metres ( 6 @ . @ 0 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 05 metres ( 3 @ . @ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 20 tons . Coloss ##al Head 2 was discovered in 1945 when Matthew Stirling ' s guide cleared away some of the vegetation and mud that covered it . The monument was found lying on its back , facing the sky , and was excavated in 1946 by Stirling and Philip Dru ##cker . In 1962 the monument was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on display as part of " The Olm ##ec tradition " exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in 1963 . San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 2 is currently in the Mus ##eo Nacional de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía in Mexico City . The head was associated with a number of ceramic finds ; they have been dated to the Early Preclassic and Late Classic periods . Coloss ##al Head 2 wears a complex head ##dress that sports a horizontal band tied at the back of the head ; this is decorated with three bird ' s heads that are located above the forehead and temples . The scal ##p piece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head . The front of the head ##dress above the horizontal band is plain . Two short str ##aps hang down from the head ##dress in front of the ears . The ear jewellery is formed by large squ ##ared ho ##ops or framed discs . The left and right ornaments are different , with radial lines on the left ear ##fl ##are , a feature absent on the right ear ##fl ##are . The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished rework ##ing process . This process has pit ##marked the entire face with at least 60 smaller hollow ##s and 2 larger holes . The surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the forehead cre ##ased into a f ##rown . The lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth ; the head has a pronounced chin .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 3 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 3 . The head measures 1 @ . @ 78 metres ( 5 @ . @ 8 ft ) high by 1 @ . @ 63 metres ( 5 @ . @ 3 ft ) wide by 0 @ . @ 95 metres ( 3 @ . @ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 9 @ . @ 4 tons . The head was discovered in a deep g ##ully by Matthew Stirling in 1946 ; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the g ##ully . The monument was found 0 @ . @ 8 kilometres ( 0 @ . @ 50 mi ) southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo , however , its original location is unknown ; erosion of the g ##ully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture . Head 3 has been moved to the Mus ##eo de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía de X ##al ##apa . The head ##dress is complex , with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal cords , with diagonal folds above each eye . A small skull ##cap tops the head ##dress . A large flap formed of four cords drops down both sides of the head , completely covering the ears . The face has a typically f ##rown ##ing brow and , unusually , has clearly defined eyel ##ids . The lips are thick and slightly parted ; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely , and the lower front of the head ##dress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 4 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 4 ) weighs 6 tons and has been moved to the Mus ##eo de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía de X ##al ##apa . Coloss ##al Head 4 is 1 @ . @ 78 metres ( 5 @ . @ 8 ft ) high , 1 @ . @ 17 metres ( 3 @ . @ 8 ft ) wide and 0 @ . @ 95 metres ( 3 @ . @ 1 ft ) deep . The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946 , 550 metres ( 600 yd ) northwest of the principal mound , at the edge of a g ##ully . When excavated , it was found to be lying on its right @ - @ hand side and in a very good state of preservation . Cer ##amic materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head 5 , making ceramic dating of the monument difficult . The head ##dress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted cords , similar to those of Head 3 . On the right @ - @ hand side , three t ##ass ##els descend from the upper portion of the head ##dress ; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band . These t ##ass ##els are judged to represent hair rather than cords . Also on the right hand side , two cords descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument . On the left @ - @ hand side , three vertical cords descend across the ear . The ear ##fl ##are is only visible on the right hand side ; it is formed of a plain disc and p ##eg . The face is that of an ageing man with a cre ##ased forehead , low cheek ##b ##ones and a prominent chin . The lips are thick and slightly parted .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 5 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 5 . The monument stands 1 @ . @ 86 metres ( 6 @ . @ 1 ft ) high and measures 1 @ . @ 47 metres ( 4 @ . @ 8 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 15 metres ( 3 @ . @ 8 ft ) deep . It weighs 11 @ . @ 6 tons . The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946 , face down in a g ##ully to the south of the principal mound . The head is particularly well executed and is likely to have been found close to its original location . Cer ##amics recovered during its excavation became mixed with those from the excavation of Head 4 . The mixed ceramics have been dated to the San Lorenzo and Villa Alta phases ( approximately 1400 – 1000 BC and 800 – 1000 AD respectively ) . Coloss ##al Head 5 is particularly well preserved , although the back of the head ##dress band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site . The band of the head ##dress is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose . The head ##dress is decorated with jaguar p ##aws ; this general identification of the decoration is contested by Beat ##ri ##z de la Fu ##ente since the " p ##aws " have three claws each ; she identifies them as the claws of a bird of prey . At the back of the head , ten interl ##aced strips form a net decorated with disc motifs . Two short str ##aps descend from the head ##dress in front of the ears . The ears are adorned with disc @ - @ shaped ear ##sp ##ool ##s with p ##egs . The face is that of an ageing man with wr ##ink ##les under the eyes and across the bridge of the nose , and a forehead that is cre ##ased in a f ##rown . The lips are slightly parted . Coloss ##al Head 5 has been moved to the Mus ##eo de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía de X ##al ##apa .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 6 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 17 ) is one of the smaller examples of colossal heads , standing 1 @ . @ 67 metres ( 5 @ . @ 5 ft ) . It measures 1 @ . @ 41 metres ( 4 @ . @ 6 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 26 metres ( 4 @ . @ 1 ft ) deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons . The head was discovered by a local farm ##work ##er and was excavated in 1965 by Luis A ##vel ##ey ##ra and Rom ##án Pi ##ña Chan . The head had collapsed into a rav ##ine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side . In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum ' s centenary exhibition . After its return to Mexico , it was placed in the Mus ##eo Nacional de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía in Mexico City . It is sculpted with a net @ - @ like head covering joined together with sculpted beads . A covering descends from under the head ##dress to cover the back half of the neck . The head ##band is divided into four strips and begins above the right ear , extending around the entire head . A short str ##ap descends from either side of the head to the ear . The ear ornaments are complex and are larger at the front of the ear than at the back . The face is that of an ageing male with the forehead cre ##ased in a f ##rown , wr ##ink ##les under the eyes , s ##agging cheeks and deep cre ##ases on either side of the nose . The face is somewhat asymmet ##ric , possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 7 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 53 ) measures 2 @ . @ 7 metres ( 8 @ . @ 9 ft ) high by 1 @ . @ 85 metres ( 6 @ . @ 1 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 35 metres ( 4 @ . @ 4 ft ) deep and weighs 18 tons . San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 7 was reworked from a monumental throne ; it was discovered by a joint archaeological project by the Instit ##uto Nacional de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía e Historia and Yale University , as a result of a magnet ##ometer survey . It was buried at a depth of less than 1 metre ( 3 @ . @ 3 ft ) and was lying facing upwards , leaning slightly northwards on its right hand side . The head is poorly preserved and has suffered both from erosion and deliberate damage . The head ##dress is decorated with a pair of human hands ; a feather ##ed ornament is carved at the back of the head ##band and two discs adorn the front . A short str ##ap descends from the head ##band and hangs in front of the right ear . The head sports large ear ##fl ##ares that completely cover the earl ##ob ##es , although severe erosion makes their exact form difficult to distinguish . The face has wr ##ink ##les between the nose and cheeks , s ##agging cheeks and deep @ - @ set eyes ; the lips are badly damaged and the mouth is open , displaying the teeth . In 1986 the head was transported to the Mus ##eo de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía de X ##al ##apa .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 8 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 61 ) stands 2 @ . @ 2 metres ( 7 @ . @ 2 ft ) high ; it measures 1 @ . @ 65 metres ( 5 @ . @ 4 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 6 metres ( 5 @ . @ 2 ft ) deep and weighs 13 tons . It is one of the finest examples of an Olm ##ec colossal head . It was found lying on its side to the south of a monumental throne . The monument was discovered at a depth of 5 metres ( 16 ft ) during a magnet ##ometer survey of the site in 1968 ; it has been dated to the Early Preclassic . After discovery it was initially reb ##ur ##ied ; it was moved to the Mus ##eo de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía de X ##al ##apa in 1986 . The head ##dress is decorated with the tal ##ons or claws of either a jaguar or an eagle . It has a head ##band and a cover that descends from under the head ##dress proper behind the ears . Two short str ##aps descend in front of the ears . The head sports large ear ornaments in the form of p ##egs . The face is that of a mature male with s ##agging cheeks and wr ##ink ##les between these and the nose . The forehead is gathered in a f ##rown . The mouth is slightly parted to reveal the teeth . Most of the head is carved in a realistic manner , the exception being the ears . These are styl ##ised and represented by one question mark shape contained within another . The head is very well preserved and displays a fine finish .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 9 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 66 . It measures 1 @ . @ 65 metres ( 5 @ . @ 4 ft ) high by 1 @ . @ 36 metres ( 4 @ . @ 5 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 17 metres ( 3 @ . @ 8 ft ) deep . The head was exposed in 1982 by erosion of the gull ##ies at San Lorenzo ; it was found leaning slightly on its right hand side and facing upwards , half covered by the collapsed side of a g ##ully and washed by a stream . Although it was documented by archaeologists , it remained for some time in its place of discovery before being moved to the Mus ##eo de Ant ##rop ##olog ##ía de X ##al ##apa . The head ##dress is of a single piece without a distinct head ##band . The sides display features that are possibly intended to represent long hair trailing to the bottom of the monument . The ear ##fl ##ares are rectangular plates with an additional tr ##ape ##z ##oid element at the front . The head is also depicted wearing a nose @ - @ ring . The face is smiling and has wr ##ink ##les under the eyes and at the edge of the mouth . It has s ##agging cheeks and wide eyes . The mouth is closed and the upper lip is badly damaged . The sculpture suffered some mut ##ilation in antiquity , with nine pits hollow ##ed into the face and head ##dress .
San Lorenzo Coloss ##al Head 10 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 89 ) has been moved to the Mus ##eo Com ##un ##itar ##io de San Lorenzo Ten ##och ##t ##it ##l ##án near Tex ##ist ##epec . It stands 1 @ . @ 8 metres ( 5 @ . @ 9 ft ) tall and measures 1 @ . @ 43 metres ( 4 @ . @ 7 ft ) wide by 0 @ . @ 92 metres ( 3 @ . @ 0 ft ) deep ; it weighs 8 tons . The head was discovered by a magnet ##ometer survey in 1994 ; it was found buried , lying face upwards in the bottom of a rav ##ine and was excavated by Ann Cyp ##hers . The head ##dress is formed of 92 circular beads that completely cover the upper part of the head and descend across the sides and back . Above the forehead is a large element forming a three @ - @ to ##ed foot with long nails , possibly the foot of a bird . The head wears large ear ##sp ##ool ##s that protr ##ude beyond the beads of the head ##dress . The sp ##ool ##s have the form of a rounded square with a circular sunken central portion . The face is that of a mature man with the mouth closed , s ##agging cheeks and lines under the eyes . The mouth is sens ##itively carved and the head possesses a pronounced chin .

Three of the La Vent ##a heads were found in a line running east @ - @ west in the northern Complex I ; all three faced northwards , away from the city centre . The other head was found in Complex B to the south of the Great Pyramid , in a plaza that included a number of other sculptures . The latter , the first of the La Vent ##a heads to be discovered , was found during archaeological exploration of La Vent ##a in 1925 ; the other three remained unknown to archaeologists until a local boy guided Matthew Stirling to them while he was excav ##ating the first head in 1940 . They were located approximately 0 @ . @ 9 kilometres ( 0 @ . @ 56 mi ) to the north of Monument 1 .
La Vent ##a Monument 1 is speculated to have been the portrait of La Vent ##a ' s final ruler . Monument 1 measures 2 @ . @ 41 metres ( 7 @ . @ 9 ft ) high by 2 @ . @ 08 metres ( 6 @ . @ 8 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 95 metres ( 6 @ . @ 4 ft ) deep ; it weighs 24 tons . The front of the head ##dress is decorated with three motifs that apparently represent the claws or f ##angs of an animal . Above these symbols is an angular U @ - @ shaped decoration descending from the scal ##p . On each side of the monument a str ##ap descends from the head ##dress , passing in front of the ear . Each ear has a prominent ear ornament that descends from the earl ##obe to the base of the monument . The features are those of a mature man , with wr ##ink ##les around the mouth , eyes and nose . Monument 1 is the best preserved head at La Vent ##a but has suffered from erosion , particularly at the back . The head was first described by Franz Blom and Oliver La Far ##ge who investigated the La Vent ##a remains on behalf of Tul ##ane University in 1925 . When discovered it was half @ - @ buried ; its massive size meant that the discover ##ers were unable to excav ##ate it completely . Matthew Stirling fully excavated the monument in 1940 , after clearing the thick vegetation that had covered it in the intervening years . Monument 1 has been moved to the Par ##que @ - @ Mus ##eo La Vent ##a in Villa ##her ##m ##osa . The head was found in its original context ; associated finds have been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC .
La Vent ##a Monument 2 measures 1 @ . @ 63 metres ( 5 @ . @ 3 ft ) high by 1 @ . @ 35 metres ( 4 @ . @ 4 ft ) wide by 0 @ . @ 98 metres ( 3 @ . @ 2 ft ) deep ; the head weighs 11 @ . @ 8 tons . The face has a broadly smiling expression that reveals four of the upper teeth . The cheeks are given prominence by the action of smiling ; the brow that is normally visible in other heads is covered by the rim of the head ##dress . The face is badly eroded , dist ##orting the features . In addition to the severe erosion damage , the upper lip and a part of the nose have been deliberately mutilated . The head was found in its original context a few metres north of the northwest corner of pyramid @ - @ platform A @ - @ 2 . Rad ##ioc ##arbon dating of the monument ' s context dates it to between 1000 and 600 BC . Monument 2 has suffered erosion damage from its exposure to the elements prior to discovery . The head has a prominent head ##dress but this is badly eroded and any individual detail has been erased . A str ##ap descends in front of the ear on each side of the head , descending as far as the earl ##obe . The head is adorned with ear ornaments in the form of a disc that covers the earl ##obe , with an associated clip or p ##eg . The surviving details of the head ##dress and ear ##fl ##ares are styl ##istically similar to those of Tres Zap ##otes Monument A . The head has been moved to the Mus ##eo del Est ##ado de Tab ##asco in Villa ##her ##m ##osa .
La Vent ##a Monument 3 stands 1 @ . @ 98 metres ( 6 @ . @ 5 ft ) high and measures 1 @ . @ 6 metres ( 5 @ . @ 2 ft ) wide by 1 metre ( 3 @ . @ 3 ft ) deep ; it weighs 12 @ . @ 8 tons . Monument 3 was located a few metres to the east of Monument 2 , but was moved to the Par ##que @ - @ Mus ##eo La Vent ##a in Villa ##her ##m ##osa . Like the other La Vent ##a heads , its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weather ##ing , making analysis difficult . It had a large head ##dress that reaches to the eyeb ##rows but any details have been lost through erosion . St ##rap ##s descend in front of each ear and continue to the base of the monument . The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the str ##aps ; they probably represent j ##ade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olm ##ec region . Although most of the facial detail is lost , the cr ##ink ##ling of the bridge of the nose is still evident , a feature that is common to the f ##rown ##ing expressions of the other Olm ##ec colossal heads .
La Vent ##a Monument 4 measures 2 @ . @ 26 metres ( 7 @ . @ 4 ft ) high by 1 @ . @ 98 metres ( 6 @ . @ 5 ft ) wide and 1 @ . @ 86 metres ( 6 @ . @ 1 ft ) deep . It weighs 19 @ . @ 8 tons . It was found a few metres to the west of Monument 2 and has been moved to the Par ##que @ - @ Mus ##eo La Vent ##a . As with the other heads in the group , its archaeological context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600 BC . The head ##dress is elaborate and , although damaged , various details are still discern ##ible . The base of the head ##dress is formed by three horizontal strips running over the forehead . One side is decorated with a double @ - @ disc motif that may have been repeated on the other ; if so , damage to the right side has obl ##iterated any trace of it . The top of the head ##dress is decorated with the claw ##ed foot of a bird of prey . Either str ##aps or pl ##a ##its of hair descend on either side of the face , from the head ##dress to the base of the monument . Only one ear ##sp ##ool survives ; it is flat , in the form of a rounded square , and is decorated with a cross motif . The ears have been completely eroded away and the lips are damaged . The surviving features display a f ##rown and cre ##asing around the nose and cheeks . The head displays prominent teeth .
= = = Tres Zap ##otes = = =
The two heads at Tres Zap ##otes , with the La Cob ##ata head , are styl ##istically distinct from the other known examples . Beat ##ri ##z de la Fu ##ente views them as a late regional survival of an older tradition while other scholars argue that they are merely the kind of regional variant to be expected in a frontier settlement . These heads are sculpted with relatively simple head ##d ##resses ; they have squ ##at , wide proportions and distinctive facial features . The two Tres Zap ##otes heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site . The discovery of one of the Tres Zap ##otes heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations of Olm ##ec culture , carried out by Matthew Stirling in 1938 .
Tres Zap ##otes Monument A ( also known as Tres Zap ##otes Coloss ##al Head 1 ) was the first colossal head to be found , discovered by accident in the middle of the nineteenth century , 1 kilometre ( 0 @ . @ 62 mi ) to the north of the modern village of Tres Zap ##otes . After its discovery it remained half @ - @ buried until it was excavated by Matthew Stirling in 1939 . At some point it was moved to the plaza of the modern village , probably in the early 1960s . It has since been moved to the Mus ##eo Com ##un ##itar ##io de Tres Zap ##otes . Monument A stands 1 @ . @ 47 metres ( 4 @ . @ 8 ft ) tall ; it measures 1 @ . @ 5 metres ( 4 @ . @ 9 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 45 metres ( 4 @ . @ 8 ft ) deep , and is estimated to weigh 7 @ . @ 8 tons . The head is sculpted with a simple head ##dress with a wide band that is otherwise un ##ad ##orn ##ed , and wears rectangular ear ornaments that project forwards onto the cheeks . The face is carved with deep cre ##ases between the cheeks and the nose and around the mouth ; the forehead is cre ##ased into a f ##rown . The upper lip has suffered recent damage , with the left portion fl ##aking away .
Tres Zap ##otes Monument Q ( also known as the Nest ##ape Head and Tres Zap ##otes Coloss ##al Head 2 ) measures 1 @ . @ 45 metres ( 4 @ . @ 8 ft ) high by 1 @ . @ 34 metres ( 4 @ . @ 4 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 26 metres ( 4 @ . @ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 8 @ . @ 5 tons . Its exact date of discovery is unknown but is estimated to have been some time in the 1940s , when it was struck by machinery being used to clear vegetation from Nest ##ape hill . Monument Q was the eleventh colossal head to be discovered . It was moved to the plaza of Santiago T ##ux ##t ##la in 1951 and remains there to this day . Monument Q was first described by Williams and He ##izer in an article published in 1965 . The head ##dress is decorated with a frontal tongue @ - @ shaped ornament , and the back of the head is sculpted with seven pl ##a ##its of hair bound with t ##ass ##els . A str ##ap descends from each side of the head ##dress , passing over the ears and to the base of the monument . The face has pronounced cre ##ases around the nose , mouth and eyes .
= = = La Cob ##ata = = =
The La Cob ##ata region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the Olm ##ec heart ##land . The La Cob ##ata colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded . It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los T ##ux ##t ##las , on the north side of El Vig ##ia volcano near to Santiago T ##ux ##t ##la . The head was largely buried when found ; excavations uncovered a Late Classic ( 600 – 900 AD ) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12 @ - @ centimet ##re ( 4 @ . @ 7 in ) long obs ##idian knife placed pointing northwards towards the head . The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted . The La Cob ##ata head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago .
The La Cob ##ata head is more or less rounded and measures 3 by 3 metres ( 9 @ . @ 8 by 9 @ . @ 8 ft ) by 3 @ . @ 4 metres ( 11 ft ) high , making it the largest known head . This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons . It is styl ##istically distinct from the other examples , and Beat ##ri ##z de la Fu ##ente placed it late in the Olm ##ec time frame . The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person . Norman Hammond argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production . The eyes of the monument are closed , the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner . The head ##dress is in the form of a plain horizontal band .
The original location of the La Cob ##ata head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination . Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished , such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base . Rock was not removed from around the ear ##sp ##ool ##s as on other heads , and does not narrow towards the base . Large parts of the monument seem to be r ##oug ##hed out without finished detail . The right hand ear ##sp ##ool also appears incomplete ; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief , probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished . The La Cob ##ata head was almost certainly carved from a raw boulder rather than being sculpted from a throne .

Tak ##al ##ik Ab ##aj Monument 23 dates to the Middle Preclassic period , and is found in Tak ##al ##ik Ab ##aj , an important city in the foothills of the Guatemalan Pacific coast , in the modern department of Ret ##al ##h ##ule ##u . It appears to be an Olm ##ec @ - @ style colossal head re @ - @ carved into a niche figure sculpture . If originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the Olm ##ec heart ##land .
Monument 23 is sculpted from andes ##ite and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed colossal heads . It stands 1 @ . @ 84 metres ( 6 @ . @ 0 ft ) high and measures 1 @ . @ 2 metres ( 3 @ . @ 9 ft ) wide by 1 @ . @ 56 metres ( 5 @ . @ 1 ft ) deep . Like the examples from the Olm ##ec heart ##land , the monument features a flat back . Lee Parsons contests John Graham ' s identification of Monument 23 as a re @ - @ carved colossal head ; he views the side ornaments , identified by Graham as ears , as rather the sc ##rolled eyes of an open @ - @ jaw ##ed monster g ##azing upwards . Counter ##ing this , James Porter has claimed that the re @ - @ carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident .
Monument 23 was damaged in the mid @ - @ twentieth century by a local mason who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel ch ##isel . As a result , the top is fragmented , although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place .

= = Early life = =
Bradley Kent Stevens grew up in Z ##ions ##ville , Indiana , where he developed his love for basketball . Starting at age five , Stevens would watch taped basketball games " before he went to afternoon kindergarten " . His father would often drive him to Bloom ##ington , to watch Indiana Hoos ##iers games . " It ' s hard not to be [ in love with basketball ] when you ' re a kid growing up in Indiana " , Stevens later said .
For his eighth birthday , Stevens received a new basketball ho ##op . " It ’ s so much fun to dream in your dr ##iv ##eway , " he later remarked . " That ’ s where my friends and I hung out . It was a lot of fun to grow up in that era . " When a friend , Brandon Monk , had a basketball court installed in his back yard , Stevens " appeared instant ##ane ##ously . " He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for gr ##illed cheese sandwiches over to Monk ' s house , so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook .
Monk ' s court soon became a gathering place , where Z ##ions ##ville kids and kids from the surrounding areas would hold pick ##up games . These games helped develop Stevens ' competitive streak . Besides playing basketball , the young Stevens also enjoyed solving puzzles , a skill he later applied to analyzing opposing teams to find their weaknesses .
Stevens attended Z ##ions ##ville Community High School , where he became a star basketball player . He wore No . 31 in high school in honor of Indiana Pac ##ers guard Reggie Miller . During his freshman year , he would get up early to practice shooting at a local gym before school . The hard work paid off as Stevens made the varsity team that same year . By the time his high school career was complete , Stevens had set school records for career scoring , assists , steals , and three @ - @ point field goals . As of 2010 , he still holds the records for points ( 150 ##8 ) , assists ( 444 ) , and steals ( 156 ) , as well as the single @ - @ season points record ( 64 ##4 in 1995 ) .

" Now , it looks like a great idea , " Stevens later remarked . " At the time , I thought it was something I really wanted to try . " Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad . " We were 23 and realized this was our chance , " Tracy later said . " Five years down the road , we were probably not going to be in a position to do that . The more success you had at Lilly , the harder it would be to leave . "

On Selection Sunday , the Bulldogs were seeded fifth in the West regional of the NCAA tournament and given a first @ - @ round match up with twelfth seeded UT ##EP on March 18 .
Many basketball commentators picked UT ##EP to pull the upset , and at halftime it looked like they might be right , as UT ##EP led 33 – 27 . Stevens made a number of halftime adjustments , and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half . The team dominated the second half and won the game 77 – 59 . Butler next faced off with thirteenth seeded Murray State .

Two days later , Stevens ' Bulldogs met second @ - @ seeded Kansas State in the regional finals .

Butler kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second half , before Kansas State went on a 13 – 2 run and took a 52 – 51 lead .

On April 3 , Brad Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs faced off with Michigan State in the national semi @ - @ finals . Michigan State took an early 14 – 7 lead , and Matt Howard got in early foul trouble , sitting most the first half . Stevens kept the team focused with a " next man up " attitude and the game was tied at 28 at halftime . The second half was dominated by tight defense for both sides . With 2 : 45 to go in the game , the score was 47 – 44 Butler . Michigan State called a time out to set up a play . Stevens correctly anticipated the play call and had Ronald N ##ored , the team ' s best defender , switch onto Kor ##ie Luc ##ious off a screen . N ##ored stole the ball and Shawn Van ##z ##ant got fou ##led on the resulting run out , hitting 1 of 2 . Tra ##iling 50 – 49 with under 30 seconds remaining , Michigan State came up empty and was forced to foul . N ##ored hit both foul shots , giving Butler a 52 – 49 lead . After a Michigan State time out , Stevens had his team foul Luc ##ious with 2 seconds remaining to prevent a potentially game tying 3 @ - @ poin ##ter . After making the first , Luc ##ious intentionally missed the second free throw . Hayward came down with the rebound to seal the victory . Butler became the first team since the shot clock was adopted for the 1985 – 86 season to hold five straight tournament opponents under 60 points .

Late in the first half , Duke went on an 8 – 0 run to take a 26 – 20 lead . Stevens called a time ##out . With starters Matt Howard and Ronald N ##ored on the bench in foul trouble , Stevens was forced to call on backup center Avery Ju ##kes who came up big for Butler . Ju ##kes scored 10 first half points , tying his season high . At half time , Duke ' s lead stood at 33 – 32 .
The second half was played very closely , with neither team taking a substantial lead . With 3 : 16 to play , Duke took a 60 – 55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith . Butler cut the lead to one point in the final minute and , after a missed Kyle Sing ##ler jump shot with 36 seconds remaining , got a chance to retake the lead . Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a time ##out to set up a play . A failed in ##b ##ounds attempt and a time ##out later , Hayward missed a bas ##eline fade @ - @ away jumper and Brian Z ##ou ##bek came down with the rebound for Duke . He was quickly fou ##led with less than 4 seconds remaining . Hayward narrowly missed a desperation half @ - @ court shot court as time expired , making the final margin 61 – 59 .
The loss snapped Butler ' s 25 @ - @ game winning streak , the longest in school history . Butler became the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970 .

= = Coaching style = =
According to Stevens , in one of his first games as head coach , he was nervous and " felt like our team played on edge " because of it . He decided that a team ' s play will reflect the mood of its coach ; a calm coach means a team that will remain po ##ised in difficult game situations , while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge . " I don ’ t want to lose a game because of my approach , " he told himself . Accordingly , he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games . He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional , instead quietly observing on the sid ##eline with folded arms . He does not get upset about bad calls by referees or player mistakes , preferring to focus on " the next play " rather than what just happened . Butler player Willie V ##eas ##ley explained Butler ' s 2010 Final Four run by saying , " When those big runs [ by Syracuse and Kansas State ] came , Coach called a time ##out and said a few calm words . Then he said he believes in us , he loves us and we ' re going to win the game . " On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player , he does it with " positive reinforcement , just at a little lou ##der dec ##ib ##el " , according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves . Above all , Stevens wants his players to be confident , not living in fear of being y ##anked for making a bad play .
Ex ##ternally , Stevens is always calm , but internally he is far from it . " I ' m not as calm as everybody thinks , " Stevens says . His wife Tracy adds , " He ’ s calm and collected , but he ’ s fiercely competitive . He ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you . " Former player Joel Corn ##ette says " Everyone sees Brad as a level @ - @ headed , calm and cool coach , but he ’ s about as competitive of a guy as I know . We would get into it constantly , whether playing two @ - @ on @ - @ two or arguing about players ’ having better college careers . "
Stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game , and always tries to add a few new wr ##ink ##les specific to that game ' s opponent . Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert " on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents ' weaknesses . " Former player Ronald N ##ored agrees : " We know everything we need to about our opponents , all their tendencies are broken down " ahead of time .
Stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions , spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film . " I think it ' s a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players " , he explains . For example , when Butler was sl ##umping in late 2010 , Stevens challenged his team : " this [ 46 % defensive field goal percentage ] is where we are . This isn ' t acceptable to get to where we want to go . But what does that really mean ? It ' s not just get better def ##ensively , it is , if we give up 3 less bask ##ets a game , then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country " . The team got the message , improved throughout the season , and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense . In 2012 , Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff . If he had the resources , Stevens says he would hire a team of statistic ##ians to analyze the teams play .
Stevens ' teams are built around solid basketball fundament ##als and good team work , rather than individual basketball skill . His teams are known for their defense , forcing opponents into unchar ##acter ##istic mistakes . The secret to basketball – and life – is " just to do the job to the best of your ability and don ' t worry about anything else , " Stevens says . " Win the next game . Win the next possession . That ' s our focus . It ' s boring . It ' s also the way championships are won " , he says . In short , Stevens is a strong believer in " The Butler Way " – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team . " I tell the players ' the Butler Way ' isn ' t easy to define , " Stevens says , " but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball , play with great energy and defend . "
Stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after " top recruits . " " The guys we [ have ] recruited , most of them weren ' t very highly ranked , " Stevens says . " They had very good high school careers or careers at other places ( transfers ) , but for one reason or the other they weren ' t seen as great players . But they all had int ##ang ##ibles . " Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a " one and done " player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally .
Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching prod ##igy , but is not interested in self @ - @ promotion . He instead prefers to defl ##ect the praise he receives to the players , athletic department , and his ment ##ors . He has not been known to posture for more money , or to leak his name for open coaching positions . He has been described as humble , modest , and not " about the money " .
The New York Times , USA Today , ESPN , and other commentators have attributed Butler ' s success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens ' coaching style . The Times remarks , " the Bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents , and they do not r ##attle easily " , and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team ' s success . " He coaches to his personality and to his strengths , " Collier says . " Ob ##v ##iously , he has great rap ##port and communication ability with his team . " Yahoo ! Sports compared Stevens to legendary coach John Wooden writing " Brad Stevens is winning at Butler the Wooden way – calm and composed on the sid ##eline . " Wooden agreed , saying , " I enjoy watching [ Stevens ] and very much enjoy [ Butler ' s ] style of play . "

Brad Stevens is known for his youthful looks , often being described as " baby @ - @ faced " . One commentator remarked , " Stevens looks like he checks the mirror every morning to see if it ' s time to start sh ##aving . " On occasion , he has been mistaken for a player . He is also known for projecting a professional , " corporate " look from the s ##idelines . Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching , he replies " If everything else remained the same , I would have been as happy as heck . . . Friends and family and faith , they ' re going to take the cake over all this stuff . " Stevens met his wife , Tracy ( née Wil ##hel ##my ) , while attending De ##P ##au ##w University . Tracy , who played soccer for De ##P ##au ##w , quickly learned of Brad ' s love for basketball ; on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game . Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995 , and from De ##P ##au ##w in 1999 . She returned to school in 2000 , driving five hours from Case Western ' s law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Brad .

Brad and Tracy Stevens are involved with the American Cancer Society ' s Coaches Vs . Cancer . Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy ' s mother died of the disease in June 2004 . The day before Butler ' s 2010 Final Four appearance , they hosted a fundraiser for the organization . Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the Ju ##kes Foundation for Kids , a charity benef ##iting Ug ##andan children run by former Butler player Avery Ju ##kes . Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family ; he notably took a one @ - @ game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith , a player on both of Butler ' s Final Four teams who was dying of cancer ; Smith died less than a week later . At the request of Andrew ' s widow , Sam , Brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17 , 2016 .

The peaks along the crater ' s rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight , while the interior is perpet ##ually in shadow ( a Crater of eternal darkness ) . The low @ - @ temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze vol ##at ##iles shed during comet impacts on the Moon . Measure ##ments by the Lunar Pro ##sp ##ector spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater , which may indicate the presence of water ice . The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton .
= = Description = =
The rotational axis of the Moon lies within Shackleton , only a few kilometers from its center . The crater is 21 km in diameter and 4 @ . @ 2 km deep . From the Earth , it is viewed edge @ - @ on in a region of rough , crater ##ed terrain . It is located within the South Pole @ - @ Ait ##ken basin on a mass ##if . The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer ramp ##art that has been only lightly impacted . No significant craters intersect the rim , and it is sl ##oped about 1 @ . @ 5 ° toward the direction 50 – 90 ° from the Earth . The age of the crater is about 3 @ . @ 6 billion years and it has been in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years .
Because the orbit of the Moon is til ##ted only 5 ° from the ecl ##iptic , the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness . Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth @ - @ based radar studies . Peaks along the rim of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight , spending about 80 – 90 % of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun . Contin ##uously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s .
The sh ##adowed portion of the crater was im ##aged with the Ter ##rain Camera of the Japanese SE ##L ##EN ##E spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim . The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30 ° slope that leads down to a 6 @ . @ 6 km diameter floor . The handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters . The bottom is covered by an uneven mound @ - @ like feature that is 300 to 400 m thick . The central peak is about 200 m in height .
The continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100 K . For Shackleton , the average temperature was determined to be about 90 K , reaching 88 K at the crater floor . Under these conditions , the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m / s . Any water vapor that arrives here following a com ##etary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface . However , the surface al ##bed ##o of the crater floor matches the lunar far @ - @ side , suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice .
This crater was named after Ernest Henry Shackleton , an Anglo @ - @ Irish explorer of Antarctica from 1901 until his death in 1922 . The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994 . Nearby craters of note include Sho ##emaker , Haw ##orth , de Ger ##l ##ache , Sverd ##rup , and Faust ##ini . Somew ##hat farther away , on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side , are the larger craters Amundsen and Scott , named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent .
= = Exploration = =
From the perspective of the Earth , this crater lies along the southern limb of the Moon , making observation difficult . Det ##ailed mapping of the polar regions and f ##ars ##ide of the Moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft . Shackleton lies entirely within the rim of the immense South Pole @ - @ Ait ##ken basin , which is one of the largest known impact formations in the Solar System . This basin is over 12 kilometers deep , and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior .
A neutron spect ##r ##ometer on board the Lunar Pro ##sp ##ector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles , including the crater Shackleton . At the end of this mission in July 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Sho ##emaker in the hope of detecting from Earth @ - @ based telescopes an impact @ - @ generated plume containing water vapor . The impact event did not produce any detect ##able water vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hyd ##rated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . Alternatively , it is possible that the crash did not excav ##ate deeply enough into the reg ##olith to liber ##ate significant quantities of water vapor .
From Earth @ - @ based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge , Shackleton appears to be relatively intact ; much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts . This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep , which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle . In addition , it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of vol ##at ##iles since its formation . However other craters in the vicinity are considerably older , and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen , possibly in the form of water ice . ( See Sho ##emaker ( lunar crater ) , for example . )
Radar studies preceding and following the Lunar Pro ##sp ##ector mission demonstrate that the inner walls of Shackleton are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some sun ##lit craters . In particular , the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its eject ##a blanket , suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface rough ##ness , and not ice deposits , as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the Clement ##ine mission . This interpretation , however , is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community . Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13 cm show no evidence for water ice deposits .
Opt ##ical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the Japanese lunar orb ##iter spacecraft K ##agu ##ya in 2007 . It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice , down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel .
On November 15 , 2008 , a 34 @ - @ kg probe made a hard landing near the crater . The moon impact probe ( MI ##P ) was launched from the Indian Chand ##r ##aya ##an @ - @ I spacecraft and reached the surface 25 minutes later . The probe carried a radar alt ##imeter , video imaging system , and a mass spect ##r ##ometer , which will be used to search for water .
= = Pot ##ential uses = =
Some sites along Shackleton ' s rim receive almost constant illumination . At these loc ##ales sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels , potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings . The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° C when the Sun is overhead , to as low as − 150 ° C during the lunar night .
While scientific experiments performed by Clement ##ine and Lunar Pro ##sp ##ector could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters , the current evidence is far from definitive . There are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice , as well as to the concentration of this " ore " with depth below the surface . Resolution of this issue will require future missions to the Moon . The presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be " mined " for deposits of hydrogen in water form , a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the Earth .
This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope . The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @ - @ continuous power to the observatory . About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5 @ - @ km tall Mal ##ap ##ert Mountain , a peak that is perpet ##ually visible from the Earth , and which could serve as a radio relay station when suit ##ably equipped .
NASA has named the rim of Shackleton as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost , slated to be up and running by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 202 ##4 . The location would promote self @ - @ sustainability for lunar residents , as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels . Furthermore , the sh ##adowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture .
= American Beauty ( 1999 film ) =
American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball . Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham , a 42 @ - @ year @ - @ old advertising executive who has a mid ##life crisis when he becomes infat ##uated with his teen ##aged daughter ' s best friend , Angela ( M ##ena Su ##v ##ari ) . Ann ##ette Ben ##ing co @ - @ stars as Lester ' s material ##istic wife , Carolyn , and Th ##ora Birch plays their insecure daughter , Jane . Wes Bentley , Chris Cooper , and Allison Jann ##ey also feature . The film is described by academics as a satire of American middle @ - @ class notions of beauty and personal satisfaction ; analysis has focused on the film ' s explor ##ations of romantic , and paternal love , sexuality , beauty , material ##ism , self @ - @ liberation , and redemption .
Ball began writing American Beauty as a play in the early 1990s , partly inspired by the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial in 1992 . He shelved the play after realizing the story would not work on stage . After several years as a television screenwriter , Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry . The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball ' s frustrating ten ##ures writing for several sit ##c ##oms . Producers Dan Jin ##ks and Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks ; the then @ - @ fledgling film studio bought Ball ' s script for $ 250 @ , @ 000 , out ##b ##idding several other production bodies . DreamWorks financed the $ 15 million production and served as its North American distributor . American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director Mendes ' film debut ; cour ##ted after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver ! and Cab ##aret , Mendes was , nevertheless , only given the job after 20 others were considered and several " A @ - @ list " directors turned down the opportunity .
Spacey was Mendes ' first choice for the role of Lester , though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider better @ - @ known actors ; similarly , the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Ben ##ing without DreamWorks ' knowledge . Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on sound ##st ##ages at the Warner Bros . back ##lot in Burbank , California , and on location in Los Angeles . Mendes ' dominant style was deliberate and composed ; he made extensive use of static shots and slow p ##ans and z ##ooms to generate tension . Cinemat ##ographer Conrad Hall complemented Mendes ' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on @ - @ screen events . During editing , Mendes made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script .
Released in North America on September 17 , 1999 , American Beauty was positively received by critics and audiences ; it was the best @ - @ reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $ 356 million worldwide . Reviewers praised most aspects of the production , with particular emphasis on Mendes , Spacey , and Ball ; criticism focused on the familiarity of the characters and setting . DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase the film ' s chances of Academy Award success ; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year , the film won Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor ( for Spacey ) , Best Original Screenplay , and Best Cinematography . It was nominated for and won many other awards and honors , mainly for the direction , writing , and acting .

Lester Burnham is a middle @ - @ aged advertising executive and magazine writer who desp ##ises his job . He is unh ##app ##ily married to Carolyn , a neu ##rotic yet fiercely ambitious real estate broker ; their teen ##aged daughter , Jane , ab ##hors her parents and has low self @ - @ esteem . The Burnham ##s ' new neighbors are retired United States Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fit ##ts and his near @ - @ cat ##at ##onic wife , Barbara . Their teen ##aged son , Ricky , constantly films his surroundings with a cam ##c ##order , collecting hundreds of recordings on videot ##apes in his bedroom . His job as a part @ - @ time bar cater ##er serves as a front for his secret marijuana dealing . Col . Fit ##ts is a strict discip ##lin ##arian who previously sent Ricky to a military school and briefly committed him to a psychiatric hospital . Jim Olm ##eyer and Jim Berk ##ley , a gay couple who live nearby , welcome the family to the neighborhood ; the homoph ##obic Col . Fit ##ts angrily asks Ricky " why these f ##agg ##ots have to rub it in your face . "
Lester becomes infat ##uated with Jane ' s vain friend , Angela Hayes , after seeing her perform a half @ - @ time dance routine at a high school basketball game . He starts having sexual fantasies about Angela , in which red rose pet ##als are a recurring motif . Carolyn begins an affair with her married business rival , Buddy Kane . When Lester ' s boss , Brad , tells him that he is to be laid off , Lester instead blackm ##ails him for $ 60 @ , @ 000 and qu ##its his job . Lester takes a minimum @ - @ wage job at a fast @ - @ food restaurant , trades in his Toyota Cam ##ry for his dream car , a 1970 Pontiac Fire ##bird , and starts working out after he over ##hears Angela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he got in shape . He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky . The girls ' friendship w ##anes after Jane starts a relationship with Ricky . Jane and Ricky bond over what Ricky considers the most beautiful imagery he has filmed : a plastic bag being blown in the wind .
Lester discovers Carolyn ' s infidelity , but reacts ind ##iffer ##ently . Buddy ends the affair , fearing an expensive divorce . Col . Fit ##ts becomes suspicious of Lester and Ricky ' s friendship when he finds his son ' s footage of Lester lifting weights while nude , which Ricky captured by chance , leading him to believe that Ricky is gay . After sp ##ying on Ricky and Lester through Lester ' s garage window , the colonel mistakenly concludes the pair is sexually involved . He later confronts and beats Ricky for the supposed affair and accuses him of being gay . Ricky falsely admits the charges and g ##oads his father into kicking him out of their home . Meanwhile , Carolyn is sitting in her car in the rain , taking a gun out of the glove box while a voice on the radio talks about not being a victim . Ricky goes to Jane ' s bedroom , finding her arguing with Angela about Angela ' s flirt ##ation with Lester . Ricky convinces Jane to flee with him to New York City and ass ##ures Angela that she is ugly , boring , and ordinary .
Col . Fit ##ts confronts Lester and attempts to kiss him ; Lester reb ##uffs the colonel , who tear ##fully flees . Carolyn puts the gun in her hand ##bag , shouting , " I refuse to be a victim ! " Lester finds a distraught Angela sitting alone in the dark ; she asks him to tell her she is beautiful . He does , and they kiss .
Carolyn drives through the rain , rehearsing a confession to Lester . Just as Lester and Angela are about to have sex , she admits that she is a virgin , and Lester changes his mind . He instead com ##forts her and the pair bond over their shared frust ##rations . Angela goes to the bathroom and Lester sm ##iles at a family photograph in his kitchen . An unseen figure raises a gun to the back of his head , a gunshot sounds , and blood spr ##ays on the wall . Ricky and Jane find Lester ' s body , while Carolyn breaks down crying in the closet . A blood ##ied Col . Fit ##ts returns home , where a gun is shown to be missing from his collection . Lester ' s closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life ; he says that , despite his death , he is happy because there is " so much beauty " in the world .
= = Themes and analysis = =
= = = Multiple interpretations = = =
Scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of American Beauty ; film critics are similarly divided , not so much about the quality of the film , as their interpretations of it . Described by many as about " the meaning of life " or " the hollow existence of the American suburbs " , the film has defied categor ##ization by even the filmmakers . Mendes is indec ##isive , saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it : " a mystery story , a k ##ale ##id ##osc ##opic journey through American suburb ##ia , a series of love stories ; [ . . . ] it was about imprisonment , [ . . . ] loneliness , [ and ] beauty . It was funny ; it was angry , sad . " The literary critic and author Wayne C . Booth concludes that the film res ##ists any one interpretation : " [ American Beauty ] cannot be adequately summarized as ' here is a satire on what ' s wrong with American life ' ; that plays down the celebration of beauty . It is more tempt ##ing to summar ##ize it as ' a portrait of the beauty underlying American m ##iseries and misd ##eeds ' , but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror , and Ball ' s disgust with our m ##ores . It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky ' s philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live . " He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center — a controlling voice who " [ un ##ites ] all of the choices " . He contends that in American Beauty ' s case , it is neither Mendes nor Ball . Mendes considers the voice to be Ball ' s , but even while the writer was " strongly influential " on set , he often had to accept dev ##iations from his vision , particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic . With " inn ##umer ##able voices intr ##uding on the original author ' s , " Booth says , those who interpret American Beauty " have forgotten to probe for the elusive center " . According to Booth , the film ' s true controller is the creative energy " that hundreds of people put into its production , agreeing and disagree ##ing , insert ##ing and cutting " .
= = = Im ##pr ##ison ##ment and redemption = = =
Mendes called American Beauty a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment . The mon ##ot ##ony of Lester ' s existence is established through his gray , n ##ond ##esc ##ript workplace and character ##less clothing . In these scenes , he is often framed as if trapped , " re ##iter ##ating rituals that hardly please him " . He mast ##urb ##ates in the confines of his shower ; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames , such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor , " confined [ and ] nearly crossed out " . The academic and author Jody W . Pen ##nington argues that Lester ' s journey is the story ' s center . His sexual re ##aw ##akening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to " [ throw ] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to desp ##ise " . After Lester shares a joint with Ricky , his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn . Chang ##ed by Ricky ' s " attractive , profound confidence " , Lester is convinced that Angela is attain ##able and sees that he must question his " ban ##al , num ##b ##ingly material ##ist suburban existence " ; he takes a job at a fast @ - @ food outlet , which allows him to reg ##ress to a point when he could " see his whole life ahead of him " .
When Lester is caught mast ##urb ##ating by Carolyn , his angry ret ##ort about their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her . By confronting the issue and Carolyn ' s " superficial investments in others " , Lester is trying to " regain a voice in a home that [ only respects ] the voices of mother and daughter " . His final turning point comes when Angela and he almost have sex ; after she confesses her virgin ##ity , he no longer thinks of her as a sex object , but as a daughter . He holds her close and " wrap ##s her up " . Mendes called it " the most satisfying end to [ Lester ' s ] journey there could possibly have been " . With these final scenes , Mendes intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a " mythical quest " . After Lester gets a beer from the refriger ##ator , the camera pushes toward him , then stops facing a hallway down which he walks " to meet his fate " . Having begun to act his age again , Lester achieves closure . As he sm ##iles at a family photo , the camera p ##ans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall , onto which blood sp ##atters as a gunshot rings out ; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester ' s death . His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky . Mendes said that Ricky ' s staring into Lester ' s dead eyes is " the culmination of the theme " of the film : that beauty is found where it is least expected .
= = = Con ##form ##ity and beauty = = =
Like other American films of 1999 — such as Fight Club , Br ##inging Out the Dead , and Magn ##olia , American Beauty instructs its audience to " [ lead ] more meaningful lives " . The film argues the case against conform ##ity , but does not deny that people need and want it ; even the gay characters just want to fit in . Jim and Jim , the Burnham ##s ' other neighbors , are a satire of " gay bourgeois cou ##pl ##edom " , who " [ invest ] in the num ##bing sam ##eness " that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples . The feminist academic and author Sally R . M ##unt argues that American Beauty uses its " art house " tr ##app ##ings to direct its message of non ##con ##form ##ity primarily to the middle classes , and that this approach is a " cliché of bourgeois preoccup ##ation ; [ . . . ] the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual ' self ' through denial and ren ##unciation is always open to those wealthy enough to choose , and s ##ly enough to present themselves symp ##at ##hetically as a rebel . "
Professor Roy M . An ##ker argues that the film ' s thematic center is its direction to the audience to " look closer " . The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the Burnham ##s ' neighborhood with Lester ' s narrated admission that he will soon die , forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them . It also sets a series of mysteries ; An ##ker asks , " from what place exactly , and from what state of being , is he telling this story ? If he ' s already dead , why bother with whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive ? There is also the question of how Lester has died — or will die . " An ##ker believes the preceding scene — Jane ' s discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father — adds further mystery . Professor Ann C . Hall disagre ##es ; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery , the film allows the audience to put it aside " to view the film and its philosophical issues " . Through this examination of Lester ' s life , rebirth and death , American Beauty satir ##izes American middle class notions of meaning , beauty and satisfaction . Even Lester ' s transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela ; he therefore remains a " willing devot ##ee of the popular media ' s ex ##alt ##ation of pub ##es ##cent male sexuality as a sens ##ible route to personal wh ##ol ##eness " . Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness ; from her belief in " house beautiful " domestic bliss to her car and gardening outfit , Carolyn ' s domain is a " fet ##ching American mill ##ennial vision of Pleasant ##ville , or Eden " . The Burnham ##s are unaware that they are " material ##ists philosoph ##ically , and devout consumers eth ##ically " who expect the " rud ##iments of American beauty " to give them happiness . An ##ker argues that " they are helpless in the face of the pret ##t ##ified economic and sexual stereotypes [ . . . ] that they and their culture have designated for their salvation . "
The film presents Ricky as its " visionary , [ . . . ] spiritual and mystical center " . He sees beauty in the min ##ut ##iae of everyday life , video ##ing as much as he can for fear of missing it . He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed : a plastic bag , toss ##ing in the wind in front of a wall . He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was " an entire life behind things " ; he feels that " sometimes there ' s so much beauty in the world I feel like I can ' t take it . . . and my heart is going to cave in . " An ##ker argues that Ricky , in looking past the " cultural d ##ross " , has " [ gras ##ped ] the rad ##iant splend ##or of the created world " to see God . As the film progresses , the Burnham ##s move closer to Ricky ' s view of the world . Lester only for ##sw ##ears personal satisfaction at the film ' s end . On the cusp of having sex with Angela , he returns to himself after she admits her virgin ##ity . Suddenly confronted with a child , he begins to treat her as a daughter ; in doing so , Lester sees himself , Angela , and his family " for the poor and fragile but wond ##rous creatures they are " . He looks at a picture of his family in happier times , and dies having had an ep ##iph ##any that inf ##uses him with " wonder , joy , and soul @ - @ shaking gratitude " — he has finally seen the world as it is .
According to Patti Bell ##anton ##i , colors are used symbolically throughout the film , none more so than red , which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and " [ defines ] Lester ' s arc " . First seen in dr ##ab colors that reflect his pass ##ivity , Lester surrounds himself with red as he reg ##ains his individual ##ity . The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol ; when Lester fantas ##izes about Angela , she is usually naked and surrounded by rose pet ##als . In these scenes , the rose symbolizes Lester ' s desire for her . When associated with Carolyn , the rose represents a " façade for suburban success " . Roses are included in almost every shot inside the Burnham ##s ' home , where they signify " a mask covering a bleak , un ##b ##ea ##ut ##iful reality " . Carolyn feels that " as long as there can be roses , all is well " . She cuts the roses and puts them in v ##ases , where they adorn her " mer ##et ##ric ##ious vision of what makes for beauty " and begin to die . The roses in the v ##ase in the Angela – Lester sed ##uction scene symbolize Lester ' s previous life and Carolyn ; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer , finally taking the roses — and thus Carolyn — out of the shot . Lester ' s ep ##iph ##any at the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red , building to a cres ##cend ##o that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels . The constant use of red " lull ##s [ the audience ] sub ##limin ##ally " into becoming used to it ; consequently , it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his blood sp ##atters on the wall .
= = = Sexual ##ity and repression = = =
Pen ##nington argues that American Beauty defines its characters through their sexuality . Lester ' s attempts to rel ##ive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela , and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact . Also sexually frustrated , Carolyn has an affair that takes her from " cold perfection ##ist " to a more care ##free soul who " [ sings ] happily along with " the music in her car . Jane and Angela constantly reference sex , through Angela ' s descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other . Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability . By the end of the film , Angela ' s hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester ' s attraction to her . Col . Fit ##ts reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim ; he asks , " How come these f ##agg ##ots always have to rub it in your face ? How can they be so sham ##eless ? " To which Ricky replies , " That ' s the thing , Dad — they don ' t feel like it ' s anything to be ash ##amed of . " Pen ##nington argues that Col . Fit ##ts ' reaction is not homoph ##obic , but an " ang ##u ##ished self @ - @ interrogation " .
With other turn @ - @ of @ - @ the @ - @ millennium films such as Fight Club , In the Company of Men ( 1997 ) , American Psycho ( 2000 ) , and Boys Don ' t Cry ( 1999 ) , American Beauty " raises the broader , widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis " . Professor Vincent Haus ##mann charges that in their reinforcement of masculinity " against threats posed by war , by consumer ##ism , and by feminist and que ##er challenges " , these films present a need to " focus on , and even to privilege " aspects of mal ##eness " deemed ' dev ##iant ' " . Lester ' s transformation conveys " that he , and not the woman , has borne the br ##unt of [ lack of being ] " and he will not stand for being em ##asc ##ulated . Lester ' s attempts to " strengthen traditional masculinity " conflict with his responsibilities as a father . Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively , he does not become " the hyper ##m ##asc ##ul ##ine figure implicit ##ly celebrated in films like Fight Club " . Haus ##mann concludes that Lester ' s behavior toward Angela is " a mis ##guided but nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again " .
Haus ##mann says the film " explicitly affir ##ms the importance of uphold ##ing the prohibition against incest " ; a recurring theme of Ball ' s work is his comparison of the tab ##oos against incest and homosexuality . Instead of making an overt distinction , American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence . Col . Fit ##ts is so ash ##amed of his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester . Ball said , " The movie is in part about how homoph ##obia is based in fear and repression and about what [ they ] can do . " The film implies two un ##ful ##f ##illed incest ##uous desires : Lester ' s pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter , while Col . Fit ##ts ' repression is exhibited through the almost sexual ##ized discipline with which he controls Ricky . Consequently , Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual , while Angela ' s vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy . Col . Fit ##ts represents Ball ' s father , whose repr ##essed homosexual desires led to his own unh ##app ##iness . Ball rewrote Col . Fit ##ts to delay revealing him as homosexual , which M ##unt reads as a possible " defer ##ment of Ball ' s own patriarchal @ - @ incest fantasies " .
= = = Tem ##por ##ality and music = = =
American Beauty follows a traditional narrative structure , only dev ##iating with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story . Although the plot spans one year , the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death . Jacqueline Fur ##by says that the plot " occupies [ . . . ] no time [ or ] all time " , citing Lester ' s claim that life did not flash before his eyes , but that it " stretches on forever like an ocean of time " . Fur ##by argues that a " rhythm of repetition " forms the core of the film ' s structure . For example , two scenes have the Burnham ##s sitting down to an evening meal , shot from the same angle . Each image is broadly similar , with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester ' s new @ - @ found assert ##iveness . Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other . Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra , and the image is reversed later for a similarly " voy ##eur ##istic and exhibition ##ist " scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment .
Lester ' s fantasies are emphasized by slow - and repetitive @ - @ motion shots ; Mendes uses double @ - @ and @ - @ triple cut ##backs in several sequences , and the score al ##ters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy . One example is the gymnasium scene — Lester ' s first encounter with Angela . While the cheer ##leaders perform their half @ - @ time routine to " On Broadway " , Lester becomes increasingly fix ##ated on Angela . Time sl ##ows to represent his " voy ##eur ##istic hypn ##osis " and Lester begins to fantas ##ize that Angela ' s performance is for him alone . " On Broadway " — which provides a conventional unders ##core to the onscreen action — is replaced by discord ##ant , perc ##uss ##ive music that lacks melody or progression . This n ##ond ##ie ##get ##ic score is important to creating the narrative st ##asis in the sequence ; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an ind ##eterm ##inate length . The effect is one that Stan Link lik ##ens to " vertical time " , described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that imp ##arts " a single present stretched out into an enormous duration , a potentially infinite ' now ' that nonetheless feels like an instant " . The music is used like a visual cue , so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela . The sequence ends with the sudden reint ##roduction of " On Broadway " and tele ##ological time .
According to Drew Miller of Stylus , the soundtrack " [ gives ] unconscious voice " to the characters ' psy ##ches and comp ##lements the subt ##ext . The most obvious use of pop music " accompanies and gives context to " Lester ' s attempts to recapture his youth ; reminiscent of how the counterc ##ulture of the 1960s comb ##ated American repression through music and drugs , Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music . Mendes ' song choices " progress through the history of American popular music " . Miller argues that although some may be over familiar , there is a par ##odic element at work , " making good on [ the film ' s ] encouragement that viewers look closer " . Toward the end of the film , Thomas Newman ' s score features more prominently , creating " a disturbing tempo " that matches the tension of the visuals . The exception is " Don ' t Let It Bring You Down " , which plays during Angela ' s sed ##uction of Lester . At first appropriate , its tone clashes as the sed ##uction stops . The lyrics , which speak of " castles burning " , can be seen as a metaphor for Lester ' s view of Angela — " the r ##osy , fantasy @ - @ driven exterior of the ' American Beauty ' " — as it burns away to reveal " the tim ##id , small @ - @ breast ##ed girl who , like his wife , has will ##fully developed a false public self " .

In 1997 , Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sit ##c ##oms Grace Under Fire and Cy ##bill . He joined the United Talent Agency , where his representative , Andrew Cann ##ava , suggested he write a spec script to " reint ##rodu ##ce [ himself ] to the town as a screenwriter " . Ball pitched three ideas to Cann ##ava : two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty , which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s . Despite the story ' s lack of an easily market ##able concept , Cann ##ava selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion . While developing the script , Ball created another television sitcom , Oh , Grow Up . He channel ##ed his anger and frustration at having to acc ##ede to network demands on that show — and during his ten ##ures on Grace Under Fire and Cy ##bill — into writing American Beauty .
Ball did not expect to sell the script , believing it would act as more of a calling card , but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies . Cann ##ava passed the script to several producers , including Dan Jin ##ks and Bruce Cohen , who took it to DreamWorks . With the help of executives Glenn Williamson and Bob Cooper , and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner , Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks ; he received assurances from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not " iron the [ edges ] out " . In an unusual move , DreamWorks decided not to option the script ; instead , in April 1998 , the studio bought it outright for $ 250 @ , @ 000 , out ##b ##idding Fox Search ##light Pictures , October Films , Metro @ - @ Goldwyn @ - @ Mayer , and Lakes ##hore Entertainment . DreamWorks planned to make the film for $ 6 – 8 million .
Jin ##ks and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film ' s development , including casting and director selection . The producers met with about 20 interested directors , several of whom were considered " A @ - @ list " at the time . Ball was not keen on the more well @ - @ known directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become " nervous about the content " . Nevertheless , the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert Zem ##eck ##is ; neither accepted . In the same year , Mendes ( then a theater director ) revived the musical Cab ##aret in New York with fellow director Rob Marshall . Beth S ##wo ##ff ##ord of the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings for Mendes with studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility . Mendes came across American Beauty in a pile of eight scripts at S ##wo ##ff ##ord ' s house , and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make ; early in his career , he had been inspired by how the film Paris , Texas ( 1984 ) presented contemporary America as a myth ##ic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty , as well as parallels with his own childhood . Mendes later met with Spielberg ; impressed by Mendes ' productions of Oliver ! and Cab ##aret , Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty .
Mendes found that he still had to convince DreamWorks ' production executives to let him direct . He had already discussed the film with Jin ##ks and Cohen , and felt they supported him . Ball was also keen ; having seen Cab ##aret , he was impressed with Mendes ' " keen visual sense " and thought he did not make obvious choices . Ball felt that Mendes liked to look under the story ' s surface , a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty . Mendes ' background also reass ##ured him , because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production . Over two meetings — the first with Cooper , Walter Park ##es , and Laurie MacDonald , the second with Cooper alone — Mendes pitched himself to the studio . The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules — $ 150 @ , @ 000 . Mendes accepted , and later recalled that after taxes and his agent ' s commission , he only earned $ 38 @ , @ 000 . In June 1998 , DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted Mendes to direct the film .

Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s . In about 1991 – 92 , Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center . He watched the bag for 10 minutes , saying later that it provoked an " unexpected emotional response " . In 1992 , Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial . Disc ##overing a comic book telling of the scandal , he was struck by how quickly it had become commercial ##ized . He said he " felt like there was a real story underneath [ that was ] more fascinating and way more tragic " than the story presented to the public , and attempted to turn the idea into a play . Ball produced around 40 pages , but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film . He felt that because of the visual themes , and because each character ' s story was . . " intensely personal " , it could not be done on a stage . All the main characters appeared in this version , but Carolyn did not feature strongly ; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles .
Ball based Lester ' s story on aspects of his own life . Lester ' s re @ - @ examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid @ - @ 3 ##0s ; like Lester , Ball put aside his passions to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect . Scenes in Ricky ' s household reflect Ball ' s own childhood experiences . Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col . Fit ##ts , a man who " gave up his chance to be himself " . Ball said the script ' s mix of comedy and drama was not intentional , but that it came uncons ##c ##iously from his own outlook on life . He said the juxtap ##osition produced a stark ##er contrast , giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone .
In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors , Lester and Angela had sex ; by the time of shooting , Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version . Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script , feeling they were being pur ##itan ##ical ; the final impetus to alter the scene came from DreamWorks ' then @ - @ president Walter Park ##es . He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology , the hero " has a moment of ep ##iph ##any before [ . . . ] tragedy occurs " . Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption . Jin ##ks and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away , as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired . Early drafts also included a flashback to Col . Fit ##ts ' service in the Marines , a sequence that unequ ##iv ##oc ##ally established his homosexual lean ##ings . In love with another Marine , Col . Fit ##ts sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the " sin " of being gay . Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film — Col . Fit ##ts was the only character to have a flashback — and because it removed the element of surprise from Col . Fit ##ts ' later pass at Lester . Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col . Fit ##ts , though all that remained in later drafts was subt ##ext .
Ball remained involved throughout production ; he had signed a television show development deal , so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to American Beauty . Ball was on @ - @ set for rewrit ##es and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming . His original book ##end scenes — in which Ricky and Jane are prosecuted for Lester ' s murder after being framed by Col . Fit ##ts — were exc ##ised in post @ - @ production ; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary , saying they were a reflection of his " anger and cyn ##icism " at the time of writing ( see " Editing " ) . Ball and Mendes revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first read @ - @ through .
The shooting script features a scene in Angela ' s car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty ; the scene differed from earlier versions , which set it as a " big scene on a freeway " in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body . The change was a practical decision , as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs . The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash , but only half a day was available . Ball agreed , but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky ' s where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman : " When you see something like that , it ' s like God is looking right at you , just for a second . And if you ' re careful , you can look right back . " Jane asks : " And what do you see ? " Ricky : " Beauty . " Ball said , " They wanted to cut that scene . They said it ' s not important . I said , ' You ' re out of your fucking mind . It ' s one of the most important scenes in the movie ! ' [ . . . ] If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie , that is the line . " Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence ; set in a school ##yard , it presents a " turning point " for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela . By the end of filming , the script had been through 10 drafts .

Mendes had Spacey and Ben ##ing in mind for the leads from the beginning , but DreamWorks executives were un ##enth ##us ##iastic . The studio suggested several alternatives , including Bruce Willis , Kevin Cost ##ner , or John Trav ##olta to play Lester , and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn . Mendes did not want a big star " weighing the film down " ; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The Us ##ual Susp ##ects and Seven , and 1992 ' s Gl ##eng ##ar ##ry Glen Ross . Spacey was surprised ; he said , " I usually play characters who are very quick , very manip ##ulative and smart . [ . . . ] I usually w ##ade in dark , sort of treacher ##ous waters . This is a man living one step at a time , playing by his instincts . This is actually much closer to me , to what I am , than those other parts . " Mendes offered Ben ##ing the role of Carolyn without the studio ' s consent ; although executives were upset at Mendes , by September 1998 , DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and Ben ##ing .
Spacey loosely based Lester ' s early " sch ##l ##ub ##by " deport ##ment on Walter Matth ##au . During the film , Lester ' s phys ##ique improves from fl ##ab ##by to toned ; Spacey worked out during filming to improve his body , but because Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order , Spacey varied post ##ures to portray the stages . Before filming , Mendes and Spacey analyzed Jack Lem ##mon ' s performance in The Ap ##artment ( 1960 ) , because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate " the way [ Lem ##mon ] moved , the way he looked , the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man " . Spacey ' s voice ##over is a throw ##back to Sunset Boulevard ( 1950 ) , which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character . Mendes felt it evoked Lester ' s — and the film ' s — loneliness . Ben ##ing recalled women from her youth to inform her performance : " I used to bab ##ys ##it constantly . You ' d go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside , and then be inside their house and see the difference . " Ben ##ing and a hair styl ##ist collaborated to create a " P ##TA president co ##if " hairst ##yle , and Mendes and production designer Naomi Sho ##han researched mail @ - @ order catalog ##s to better establish Carolyn ' s environment of a " spot ##less suburban manor " . To help Ben ##ing get into Carolyn ' s mind ##set , Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like . He lent Ben ##ing the Bobby Darin version of the song " Don ' t Rain on My Parade " , which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car .
For the roles of Jane , Ricky , and Angela , DreamWorks gave Mendes cart ##e bl ##anche . By November 1998 , Th ##ora Birch , Wes Bentley , and M ##ena Su ##v ##ari had been cast in the parts — in Birch ' s case , despite the fact she was under ##age for her nude scene . As Birch was 16 at the time she made the film , and thus classified as a minor in the United States , her parents had to approve her brief to ##pless scene in the movie . Child labor representatives and they were on the set for the shooting of the scene . Bentley overcame competition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast . The 2009 documentary My Big Break followed Bentley , and several other young actors , before and after he landed the part . To prepare , Mendes provided Bentley with a video camera , telling the actor to film what Ricky would . Peter Gallagher and Alison Jann ##ey were cast ( as Buddy Kane and Barbara Fit ##ts ) after filming began in December 1998 . Mendes gave Jann ##ey a book of paintings by Ed ##v ##ard Munch . He told her , " Your character is in there somewhere . " Mendes cut much of Barbara ' s dialogue , including conversations between Colonel Fit ##ts and her , as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence . Chris Cooper plays Colonel Fit ##ts , Scott Bak ##ula plays Jim Olm ##eyer , and Sam Rob ##ards plays Jim Berk ##ley . Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal , happy — and boring — couple in the film . Ball ' s inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a " bland , boring , heterosexual couple " who wore matching clothes : " I can ' t wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring . " Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same for ##en ##ame .
Mendes insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals , although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater , and the actors could not be present at every one . Several improvis ##ations and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script . An early scene showing the Burnham ##s leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester ' s relationship had reached . Spacey and Ben ##ing worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another ; for example , the scene in which Lester almost sed ##uces Carolyn after the pair argues over Lester ' s buying a car was originally " strictly contentious " .

Principal photography lasted about 50 days from December 14 , 1998 , to February 1999 . American Beauty was filmed on sound ##st ##ages at the Warner Bros . back ##lot in Burbank , California , and at Hancock Park and Brent ##wood in Los Angeles . The aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in Sacramento , California , and many of the school scenes were shot at South High School in Tor ##rance , California ; several extras in the gym crowd were South High students . The film is set in an upper middle @ - @ class neighborhood in an unidentified American town . Production designer Naomi Sho ##han likened the loc ##ale to Evan ##ston , Illinois , but said , " it ' s not about a place , it ' s about an archety ##pe . [ . . . ] The mil ##ieu was pretty much Any ##where , USA — upward ##ly mobile suburb ##ia . " The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters , who are also archety ##pes . Sho ##han said , " All of them are very strained , and their lives are const ##ructs . " The Burnham ##s ' household was designed as the reverse of the Fit ##ts ' — the former a pr ##istine ideal , but grac ##eless and lacking in " inner balance " , leading to Carolyn ' s desire to at least give it the appearance of a " perfect all @ - @ American household " ; the Fit ##ts ' home is depicted in " exaggerated darkness [ and ] symmetry " .
The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner back ##lot ' s " Blond ##ie Street " for the Burnham and Fit ##ts ' homes . The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane ' s bedroom windows , and between Ricky ' s bedroom and Lester ' s garage . The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col . Fit ##ts — watching from Ricky ' s bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex . Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the back ##lot , on location , and on sound ##st ##ages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the Burnham ##s ' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the Fit ##ts ' home was shot in the city ' s Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky ' s bedroom was designed to be cell @ - @ like to suggest his " monk ##ish " personality , while at the same time blending with the high @ - @ tech equipment to reflect his voy ##eur ##istic side . The production deliberately minim ##ized the use of red , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . The Burnham ##s ' home uses cool blues , while the Fit ##ts ' is kept in a " depressed military palette " .
Mendes ' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed , with a minimalist design that provided " a sparse , almost surreal feeling — a bright , crisp , hard edged , near Mag ##rit ##te @ - @ like take on American suburb ##ia " ; Mendes constantly directed his set dress ##ers to empty the frame . He made Lester ' s fantasy scenes " more fluid and graceful " , and Mendes made minimal use of stead ##ic ##ams , feeling that stable shots generated more tension . For example , when Mendes used a slow push in to the Burnham ##s ' dinner table , he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters . He wanted to keep the tension in the scene , so he only cut away when Jane left the table . Mendes did use a hand @ - @ held camera for the scene in which Col . Fit ##ts beats Ricky . Mendes said the camera provided the scene with a " kinetic [ . . . ] off @ - @ balance energy " . He also went hand @ - @ held for the excerpts of Ricky ' s cam ##c ##order footage . Mendes took a long time to get the quality of Ricky ' s footage to the level he wanted . For the plastic @ - @ bag footage , Mendes used wind machines to move the bag in the air . The scene took four takes ; two by the second unit did not satisfy Mendes , so he shot the scene himself . He felt his first take lacked grace , but for the last attempt , he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground . Mendes was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag .
Mendes avoided using close @ - @ ups , as he believed the technique was over ##used ; he also cited Spielberg ' s advice that he should imagine an audience silhou ##etted at the bottom of the camera monitor , to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a 40 @ - @ foot ( 10 m ) screen . Spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a " great idea " toward the end of a long working day . Mendes said , " That happened three or four times , and they are all in the movie . " Despite Spielberg ' s support , DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget , although the studio interfered little with the film ' s content . Spacey , Ben ##ing and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates . American Beauty cost DreamWorks $ 15 million to produce , slightly above their projected sum . Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days ' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to resh ##oot the scenes . He said , " I started with a wrong scene , actually , a comedy scene . And the actors played it way too big : [ . . . ] it was badly shot , my fault , badly composed , my fault , bad costumes , my fault [ . . . ] ; and everybody was doing what I was asking . It was all my fault . " Aware that he was a nov ##ice , Mendes drew on the experience of Hall : " I made a very conscious decision early on , if I didn ' t understand something technically , to say , without embarrassment , ' I don ' t understand what you ' re talking about , please explain it . ' "
Mendes encouraged some improvisation ; for example , when Lester mast ##urb ##ates in bed beside Carolyn , the director asked Spacey to improv ##ise several e ##up ##hem ##isms for the act in each take . Mendes said , " I wanted that not just because it was funny [ . . . ] but because I didn ' t want it to seem rehearsed . I wanted it to seem like he was bl ##ur ##ting it out of his mouth without thinking . [ Spacey ] is so in control — I wanted him to break through . " Spacey obliged , eventually coming up with 35 phrases , but Ben ##ing could not always keep a straight face , which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times . The production used small amounts of computer @ - @ generated imagery . Most of the rose pet ##als in Lester ' s fantasies were added in post @ - @ production , although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed . When Lester fantas ##izes about Angela in a rose @ - @ pet ##al bath , the steam was real , save for in the overhead shot . To position the camera , a hole had to be cut in the ceiling , through which the steam escaped ; it was instead added digitally .
= = = Editing = = =
American Beauty was edited by Christopher Green ##bury and T ##ari ##q An ##war ; Green ##bury began in the position , but had to leave halfway through post @ - @ production because of a scheduling conflict with Me , Myself and Irene ( 2000 ) ( in which Chris Cooper also starred ) . Mendes and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the appointments . Mendes realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned . He believed he had been making a " much more whims ##ical , [ . . . ] k ##ale ##id ##osc ##opic " film than what came together in the edit suite . Instead , Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to disc ##ard to craft the film along these lines . In total , he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit . The opening included a dream in which Lester imag ##ines himself flying above the town . Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against blues ##creen , but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whims ##ical — " like a Coen brothers movie " — and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set . The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father . This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester ' s death , as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane ' s request was not serious . However , in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full scene plays out later — Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt . The subsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for the blues ##creen effects in the dream sequence .
Mendes spent more time rec ##ut ##ting the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together . He tri ##alled several versions of the opening ; the first edit included book ##end scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester ' s murder , but Mendes exc ##ised these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery , and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production . Mendes believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film " into an episode of NY ##PD Blue " . Instead , he wanted the ending to be " a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution " . When Ball first saw a completed edit , it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes . He felt that they were so short that they " didn ' t really register " . Mendes and he argued , but Ball was more accepting after Mendes cut the sequences completely ; Ball felt that without the scenes , the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that " for all its darkness had a really romantic heart " .
= = = Cinematography = = =
Conrad Hall was not the first choice for director of photography ; Mendes believed he was " too old and too experienced " to want the job , and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with . Instead , Mendes asked Fred El ##mes , who turned the job down because he did not like the script . Hall was recommended to Mendes by Tom Cruise , because of Hall ' s work on Without Lim ##its ( 1998 ) , which Cruise had executive produced . Mendes was directing Cruise ' s then @ - @ wife Nicole Kid ##man in the play The Blue Room during prep ##roduction on American Beauty , and had already storyboard ##ed the whole film . Hall was involved for one month during prep ##roduction ; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script , and further passes allowed him to ref ##ine his approach before meeting Mendes . Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters ; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals , which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals .
Hall ' s approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked classic ##ism , to contrast with the turbulent on @ - @ screen events and allow audiences to take in the action . Hall and Mendes first discussed the intended mood of a scene , but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary . In most cases , Hall first lit the scene ' s subject by " painting in " the blacks and whites , before adding fill light , which he reflected from be ##ad ##board or white card on the ceiling . This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill light un ##ob ##tr ##usive and the dark areas free of spill . Hall shot American Beauty in a 2 @ . @ 39 : 1 aspect ratio in the Super 35 format , using Kod ##ak Vision 500 ##T 52 ##79 35 mm film stock . He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the pet ##al @ - @ filled pool in its overhead shot , creating a frame around Angela within . He shot the whole film at the same T @ - @ stop ( T ##1 . 9 ) ; given his preference for shooting that wide , Hall favored high @ - @ speed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects . He used Pan ##av ##ision Platinum cameras with the company ' s Prim ##o series of prime and z ##oom lenses . Hall employed Kod ##ak Vision 200 ##T 527 ##4 and EX ##R 52 ##48 stock for scenes with daylight effects . He had difficulty adjusting to Kod ##ak ' s newly introduced Vision release print stock , which , combined with his contrast @ - @ heavy lighting style , created a look with too much contrast . Hall contacted Kod ##ak , who sent him a batch of 52 ##79 that was 5 % lower in contrast . Hall used a 1 / 8 inch Tiff ##en Black Pro ##M ##ist filter for almost every scene , which he said in retrospect may not have been the best choice , as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for its an ##amorph ##ic release print led to a slight amount of degradation ; therefore , the diffusion from the filter was not required . When he saw the film in a theater , Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter , the diffusion from the Super 35 – an ##amorph ##ic conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended .
A shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes . Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence ; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy , so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building , intending to light from the top of the truck . When Mendes returned , he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen . He removed the truck and Hall had to ret ##h ##ink the lighting ; he lit it from the left , with a large light crossing the actors , and with a soft light behind the camera . Hall felt the consequent wide shot " worked perfectly for the tone of the scene " . Hall made sure to keep rain , or the suggestion of it , in every shot near the end of the film . In one shot during Lester ' s encounter with Angela at the Burnham ##s ' home , Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights ; in another , he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower , intensifying the light ( although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene , Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced ) . For the close @ - @ ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch , Hall tried to keep rain in the frame , lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester . He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room .

Thomas Newman ' s score was recorded in Santa Monica , California . He mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm , the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes . Newman " favored pulse , rhythm , and color over melody " , making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created . He built each cue around " small , end ##lessly repeating phrases " — often , the only variety through a " thin ##ning of the texture for eight bars " . The percussion instruments included tab ##las , b ##ong ##os , cymb ##als , piano , x ##yl ##oph ##ones , and mar ##imb ##as ; also featured were guitars , flute , and world music instruments . Newman also used electronic music and on " qu ##irk ##ier " tracks employed more unorthodox methods , such as t ##apping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a det ##un ##ed mand ##olin . Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the " moral ambiguity " of the script : " It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve [ that ] . "
The soundtrack features songs by Newman , Bobby Darin , The Who , Free , E ##els , The Gu ##ess Who , Bill W ##ithers , Betty Carter , Peggy Lee , The Folk Im ##pl ##osion , Gomez , and Bob Dylan , as well as two cover versions — The Beatles ' " Because " performed by Elliott Smith , and Neil Young ' s " Don ' t Let It Bring You Down " performed by Annie Lennox . Produced by the film ' s music supervisor Chris D ##our ##idas , an abrid ##ged soundtrack album was released on October 5 , 1999 , and went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album . An album featuring 19 tracks from Newman ' s score was released on January 11 , 2000 , and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album . Film ##maker considered the score to be one of Newman ' s best , saying it " [ enabled ] the film ' s transcend ##ental ##ist aspirations " . In 2006 , the magazine chose the score as one of 20 essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the " complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling " .

DreamWorks contracted Amazon . com to create the official website , marking the first time that Amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film . The website included an overview , a photo gallery , cast and crew film ##ographies , and exclusive interviews with Spacey and Ben ##ing . The film ' s tagline — " look closer " — originally came from a cutting past ##ed on Lester ' s workplace cub ##icle by the set dress ##er . DreamWorks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers — one aimed at adults , the other at teenagers . Both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose . Reviewing the posters of several 1999 films , David Hoch ##man of Entertainment Weekly rated American Beauty ' s highly , saying it evoked the tagline ; he said , " You return to the poster again and again , thinking , this time you ' re gonna find something . " DreamWorks did not want to test screen the film ; according to Mendes , the studio was pleased with it , but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward . The studio reluctantly agreed and showed the film to a young audience in San Jose , California . Mendes claimed the screening went very well .

The film had its world premiere on September 8 , 1999 , at Gra ##uman ' s Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles . Three days later , the film appeared at the Toronto International Film Festival . With the filmmakers and cast in attendance , it screened at several American universities , including the University of California at Berkeley , New York University , the University of California at Los Angeles , the University of Texas at Austin , and Northwestern University .
On September 15 , 1999 , American Beauty opened to the public in limited release at three theaters in Los Angeles and three in New York . More theaters were added during the limited run , and on October 1 , the film officially entered wide release by screening in 70 ##6 theaters across North America . The film grossed $ 8 @ , @ 188 @ , @ 58 ##7 over the weekend , ranking third at the box office .

American Beauty was released on VHS on May 9 , 2000 , and on DVD with the D ##TS format on October 24 , 2000 . Before the North American rental release on May 9 , Block ##buster Video wanted to purchase hundreds of thousands of extra copies for its " guaranteed title " range , whereby anyone who wanted to rent the film would be guaranteed a copy . Block ##buster and DreamWorks could not agree on a profit @ - @ sharing deal , so Block ##buster ordered two @ - @ thirds the number of copies it originally intended . DreamWorks made around one million copies available for rental ; Block ##buster ' s share would usually have been about 400 @ , @ 000 of these . Some Block ##buster stores only displayed 60 copies , and others did not display the film at all , forcing customers to ask for it . The strategy required staff to read a statement to customers explaining the situation ; Block ##buster claimed it was only " [ monitoring ] customer demand " due to the reduced availability . Block ##buster ' s strategy leaked before May 9 , leading to a 30 % order increase from other retailers . In its first week of rental release , American Beauty made $ 6 @ . @ 8 million . This return was lower than would have been expected had DreamWorks and Block ##buster reached an agreement . In the same year , The Sixth Sense made $ 22 million , while Fight Club made $ 8 @ . @ 1 million , though the latter ' s North American theatrical performance was just 29 % that of American Beauty . Block ##buster ' s strategy also affected rental fees ; American Beauty averaged $ 3 @ . @ 12 , compared with $ 3 @ . @ 40 for films that Block ##buster fully promoted . Only 53 % of the film ' s rent ##als were from large outlets in the first week , compared with the usual 65 % .
The DVD release included a behind @ - @ the @ - @ scenes feature ##tte , film audio commentary from Mendes and Ball , and a storyboard presentation with discussion from Mendes and Hall . In the film commentary , Mendes refers to deleted scenes he intended to include in the release . However , these scenes are not on the DVD , as he changed his mind after recording the commentary ; Mendes felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to use would detract from the film ' s integrity .
On September 21 , 2010 , Paramount Home Entertainment released American Beauty on Blu @ - @ ray , as part of Paramount ' s Sapphire Series . All the extras from the DVD release were present , with the theatrical trailers upgraded to HD .
= = Critical reception = =
American Beauty was widely considered the best film of 1999 by the American press . It received overwhelming praise , chiefly for Spacey , Mendes and Ball . Variety reported that " no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal r ##aves . " It was the best @ - @ received title at the Toronto International Film Festival ( TI ##F ##F ) , where it won the People ' s Choice award after a ballot of the festival ' s audiences . TI ##F ##F ' s director , Piers Hand ##ling , said , " American Beauty was the buzz of the festival , the film most talked @ - @ about . "
Writing in Variety , Todd McCarthy said the cast ensemble " could not be better " ; he praised Spacey ' s " handling of inn ##uend ##o , subtle sarc ##asm , and blunt talk " and the way he imb ##ued Lester with " genuine feeling " . Janet Mas ##lin in The New York Times said Spacey was at his " w ##itt ##iest and most agile " to date , and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @ - @ Times singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who " does reckless and foolish things [ but who ] doesn ' t dece ##ive himself " . Kevin Jackson of Sight & Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances , the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of " both sap and hero " . Writing in Film Quarterly , Gary H ##ent ##zi praised the actors , but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col . Fit ##ts were stereotypes . H ##ent ##zi accused Mendes and Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky , saying the latter was their " fantasy figure " — a teen ##aged boy who ' s an absurd ##ly wealthy artist able to " finance [ his ] own projects " . H ##ent ##zi said Angela was the most believable teenager , in particular with her " pain ##fully familiar " attempts to " live up to an un ##worthy image of herself " . Mas ##lin agreed that some characters were un ##original , but said their detailed character ##izations made them memorable . Kenneth Tur ##an of the Los Angeles Times said the actors cop ##ed " fault ##lessly " with what were difficult roles ; he called Spacey ' s performance " the energy that drives the film " , saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester not always being sympathetic . " Against considerable odds , we do like [ these characters ] , " Tur ##an concluded .
Mas ##lin felt that Mendes directed with " terrific visual flair " , saying his minimalist style balanced " the m ##ord ##ant and bright " and that he evoked the " delicate , erotic ##ized power @ - @ playing vign ##ettes " of his theater work . Jackson said Mendes ' theatrical roots rarely showed , and that the " most remarkable " aspect was that Spacey ' s performance did not overs ##h ##adow the film . He said that Mendes worked the script ' s intric ##acies smoothly , to the ensemble ' s strengths , and staged the tonal shifts skill ##fully . McCarthy believed American Beauty a " stunning card of introduction " for film début ##antes Mendes and Ball . He said Mendes ' " sure hand " was " as precise and controlled " as his theater work . McCarthy cited Hall ' s involvement as fortunate for Mendes , as the cinematographer was " uns ##ur ##pass ##ed " at conveying the themes of a work . Tur ##an agreed that Mendes ' choice of collaborators was " shrew ##d " , naming Hall and Newman in particular . Tur ##an suggested that American Beauty may have benefited from Mendes ' inexperience , as his " anything ' s possible daring " made him attempt beats that more seasoned directors might have avoided . Tur ##an felt that Mendes ' accomplishment was to " capture and enhance [ the ] duality " of Ball ' s script — the simultaneously " caric ##at ##ured [ . . . ] and pain ##fully real " characters . H ##ent ##zi , while critical of many of Mendes and Ball ' s choices , admitted the film showed off their " considerable talents " .
Tur ##an cited Ball ' s lack of const ##r ##aint when writing the film as the reason for its uniqu ##eness , in particular the script ' s subtle changes in tone . McCarthy said the script was " as fresh and distinctive " as any of its American film contemporaries , and praised how it analyzed the characters while not comprom ##ising narrative pace . He called Ball ' s dialogue " tart " and said the characters — Carolyn except ##ed — were " deeply drawn " . One other flaw , McCarthy said , was the revelation of Col . Fit ##ts ' homosexuality , which he said evoked " ho ##ary Freud ##ian ##ism " . Jackson said the film transcend ##ed its clich ##éd setup to become a " wonderfully resource ##ful and s ##omb ##re comedy " . He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs , it did so with " unexpected nu ##ance " . H ##ent ##zi criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester ' s murder , believing it manip ##ulative and simply a way of generating suspense . McCarthy cited the production and costume design as pl ##uses , and said the soundtrack was good at creating " ironic counterpoint [ s ] " to the story . H ##ent ##zi concluded that American Beauty was " vital but uneven " ; he felt the film ' s examination of " the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other ' s lives " was its best point , and that although Lester and Angela ' s dynamic was familiar , its romantic irony stood beside " the most enduring literary treatments " of the theme , such as Lol ##ita . Nevertheless , H ##ent ##zi believed that the film ' s themes of material ##ism and conform ##ity in American suburb ##ia were " hack ##ney ##ed " . McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar , but said it merely provided the film with a " starting point " from which to tell its " subtle and ac ##utely judged tale " . Mas ##lin agreed ; she said that while it " takes aim at targets that are none too fresh " , and that the theme of non ##con ##form ##ity did not surprise , the film had its own " cor ##ros ##ive novelty " . Ebert awarded American Beauty four stars out of four , and Tur ##an said it was layered , subversive , complex , and surprising , concluding it was " a hell of a picture " .
A few months after the film ' s release , reports of a backlash appeared in the American press , and the years since have seen its critical regard w ##ane . In 2005 , Prem ##iere named American Beauty as one of 20 " most over ##rated movies of all time " ; Mendes accepted the inev ##it ##ability of the critical reapp ##ra ##isal , saying , " I thought some of it was entirely justified — it was a little overp ##ra ##ised at the time . "
Currently , the film holds an 88 % score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 180 reviews , with an average rating of 8 @ . @ 2 / 10 ; the critical consensus reads , " Fl ##aw ##lessly cast and br ##im ##ming with dark , acid wit , American Beauty is a smart , provocative high point of late ' 90s mainstream Hollywood film . " Metacritic gives the film a score of 86 , based on 33 reviews , indicating " universal acclaim . "

American Beauty was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season . Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999 , and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end @ - @ of @ - @ year lists . The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999 , but while the New York Film Critics Circle , the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty , they gave their top awards to other films . By the end of the year , reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the under ##dog in the race for Best Picture ; however , at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000 , American Beauty won Best Film , Best Director and Best Screenplay .
As the nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards approached , a front ##runner had not emerged . DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for American Beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5 @ , @ 600 Academy Award voters . Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies . Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited , DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in " casual , comfortable settings " in voters ' communities . The studio ' s candidate for Best Picture the previous year , Saving Private Ryan , lost to Shakespeare in Love , so the studio took a new approach by hiring outs ##iders to provide input for the campaign . It hired three veteran consultants , who told the studio to " think small " . Nancy Will ##en encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of American Beauty , to set up displays of the film in the communities ' book ##st ##ores , and to arrange a question @ - @ and @ - @ answer session with Mendes for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts . Dale Olson advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in Beverly Hills — home to many voters — in addition to major newspapers . Olson arranged to screen American Beauty to about 1 @ , @ 000 members of the Actors Fund of America , as many participating actors were also voters . Bruce Feldman took Ball to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival , where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of Anthony Hopkins , meeting several voters who were in attendance .
In February 2000 , American Beauty was nominated for eight Academy Awards ; its closest rivals , The C ##ider House Rules and The Ins ##ider , received seven nominations each . In March 2000 , the major industry labor organizations all awarded their top honors to American Beauty ; perceptions had shifted — the film was now the favorite to dominate the Academy Awards . American Beauty ' s closest rival for Best Picture was still The C ##ider House Rules , from Mir ##am ##ax . Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns ; DreamWorks bought 38 % more advertising space in Variety than Mir ##am ##ax . On March 26 , 2000 , American Beauty won five Academy Awards : Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor ( Spacey ) , Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography . At the 53rd British Academy Film Awards , American Beauty won six of the 14 awards for which it was nominated : Best Film , Best Actor , Best Actress ( Ben ##ing ) , Best Cinematography , Best Film Music and Best Editing . In 2000 , the Public ##ists Guild of America recognized DreamWorks for the best film publicity campaign . In September 2008 , Empire named American Beauty the 96 ##th " Greatest Movie of All Time " after a poll of 10 @ , @ 000 readers , 150 filmmakers , and 50 film critics , the fourth @ - @ highest ranked movie from 1999 ( behind Fight Club , The Matrix , and Magn ##olia ) . In 2013 , the Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay number 38 on its list of 101 greatest screen ##plays .
The film was nominated for AFI ' s 100 Years . . . 100 Movies ( 10th Anniversary Edition ) in 2007 .
= Christopher Gore =
Christopher Gore ( September 21 , 1758 – March 1 , 1827 ) was a prominent Massachusetts lawyer , Federalist politician , and U . S . diplomat . Born into a family divided by the American Revolution , Gore sided with the victorious Patriots , established a successful law practice in Boston , and built a fortune by purchasing Revolutionary government debts at a discount and receiving full value for them from the government .
Gore entered politics in 1788 , serving briefly in the Massachusetts legislature before being appointed U . S . District Attorney for Massachusetts . He was then appointed by President George Washington to a diplomatic commission dealing with maritime claims in Great Britain . He returned to Massachusetts in 1804 and re ##ent ##ered state politics , running unsuccessfully for governor several times before winning in 1809 . He served one term , losing to Democratic @ - @ Republican El ##bridge Gerry in 1810 . He was appointed to the US Senate by Governor Cal ##eb Strong in 1813 , where he led opposition to the War of 1812 .
Gore invested his fortune in a variety of businesses , including important infrastructure projects such as the Middlesex Canal and a bridge across the Charles River . He was a major investor in the early textile industry , funding the Boston Manufacturing Company and the Mer ##rim ##ack Manufacturing Company , whose business established the city of Lowell , Massachusetts . Gore was involved in a variety of charitable causes , and was a major benefactor of Harvard College , where the first library was named in his honor . His pal ##at ##ial mansion in W ##alth ##am , Massachusetts , now known as Gore Place , is one of the finest extant examples of Federalist architecture , and has been declared a National Historic Landmark .
= = Early years = =
Christopher Gore was born in Boston on September 21 , 1758 , one of many children of Frances and John Gore , a successful merchant and art ##isan . He was the youngest of their three sons to survive to adulthood . He attended Boston Latin School , and entered Harvard College at the young ( even for the time ) age of thirteen . At the outset of the American Revolutionary War and the Siege of Boston in 1775 , Harvard ' s buildings were occupied by the Continental Army , and Gore temporarily continued his studies in Bradford until Harvard could resume operations in Concord . While at Harvard Gore participated in a speaking club , and formed significant lifelong friendships with Rufus King and John Tr ##umb ##ull .
Gore graduated in 1776 , and promptly enlisted in the Continental artillery regiment of his brother @ - @ in @ - @ law Thomas Crafts , where he served as a clerk until 1778 . The Gore family was divided by the war : Gore ' s father was a Loyalist who left Boston when the British Army evacuated the city in March 1776 . Gore was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters , who remained in Boston . In 1779 Gore successfully petitioned the state for the remaining family ' s share of his father ' s seized assets .
= = Early legal career = =
After his military service Gore studied law with John Lowell , and was admitted to the bar in 1778 after a comparatively brief tut ##elage . Gore ' s law practice flourished , in part because many Loyalist lawyers had fled Massachusetts . Gore ' s clients included Loyalists seeking to recover some of their assets , as well as London @ - @ based British merchants with claims to pursue . His brief ##s were generally well @ - @ reasoned , and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer .
Gore grew his fortune by investing carefully in revolutionary currency and bonds . The securities he purchased were paper that had been given to Continental Army soldiers in lieu of pay , which they often sold at a steep discount . One batch of securities he purchased , for instance , cost him about $ 3 @ , @ 700 but had a face value of $ 25 @ , @ 000 . In 1785 he married Rebecca Am ##ory Payne , daughter of a wealthy merchant , maritime ins ##urer , and director of the Bank of Massachusetts . The couple were known for their social gr ##aces and became prominent members of Boston society .
In 1786 Gore became concerned about a rise in anti @ - @ lawyer sentiment in Massachusetts . Gri ##ev ##ances over harsh policies pursued by Governor James Bow ##d ##oin bloss ##omed into Sh ##ays ' Rebellion , which required militia action to crush in 1787 . Gore was one of several high @ - @ profile lawyers assigned to defend participants in the rebellion ( included in this group were Theodore Sed ##g ##wick , Cal ##eb Strong , James Sullivan , Levi Lincoln , Sr . , and Thomas Daw ##es ) . Although many rebels were ultimately convicted , a large number received amnesty . In 1788 , Gore was elected a delegate to the 1789 Massachusetts convention that ratified the United States Constitution . His election was contested because Boston , where he lived , was at the time more inclined toward state power . Gore nonetheless was strongly Federalist , urging support of the new Constitution .
= = Legisl ##ator , banker , and spec ##ulator = =
In 1788 Gore was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives . He took a leading role in adopting the state ' s rules for actions required of it by the new federal constitution . By his proposal the legislature decided that presidential electors would be chosen by a joint session . He also proposed that the state House and Senate agree by separate votes on choices for the United States Senate , a process that would significantly reduce popular input to the choice . His choice was ultimately rejected in favor of a process whereby the House selected a slate of candidates , from which the Senate would choose one . In 1789 Gore decided to stand for reelection , but lost , owing to strong anti @ - @ nationalist ferv ##or in Boston at the time . He managed to win a seat later , when a special election was held after resign ##ations opened several seats .
Gore ' s financial spec ##ulations in the late 178 ##0s significantly multiplied his wealth . In 1788 he and Andrew Craig ##ie , a Boston businessman who had retained Gore for legal services , entered into a secret agreement to purchase Continental securities with a face value of $ 100 @ , @ 000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise . By late October of that year , the pair had met this goal : Gore had purchased $ 90 @ , @ 000 worth of paper for about $ 20 @ , @ 000 , and encouraged Craig ##ie to purchase more than the $ 11 @ , @ 000 he had acquired if his funding would allow for it . Gore also purchased Massachusetts war @ - @ related debts , and lobbied Massachusetts Congress ##men for the U . S . government to assume those as well .
Gore ' s wind ##fall was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress , acting on a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore ' s friend Rufus King , passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U . S . paper at face value . Not only did Gore win on this exchange , but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it . The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents : John Quincy Adams wrote that Gore ' s spec ##ulations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country .
The success of Gore ' s spec ##ulations prompted him to enter a partnership with Craig ##ie , William Du ##er and Daniel Parker in an attempt to acquire U . S . foreign debt obligations on favorable terms . Parker was a business partner of Craig ##ie ' s , and Du ##er was an influential New York businessman and Treasury Department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed Gore . The partnership promoted sales of U . S . lands in Europe , and sought to acquire U . S . obligations to France . Although Gore sank $ 10 @ , @ 000 into this venture , it failed : more powerful and experienced Dutch bankers out ##man ##eu ##ver ##ed the Americans . Gore also engaged in other ventures with these partners , but apparently carefully stayed with financial spec ##ulations , and avoided the partners ' less successful land ventures .
Much of Gore ' s financial activity was mediated through the Bank of Massachusetts , where his father @ - @ in @ - @ law was a director . Gore himself was elected to its board in 1785 , when he also became a shareholder . During his time on the board the bank tight ##ened its regulations on loan repay ##ments , a move that improved the stability of its capital . Gore used the bank for most of his personal deposits , but also drew on lines of credit for as much as several thousand dollars . The bank shares he held paid relatively high divide ##nds until 1791 , when the bank received serious competition from the First Bank of the United States .
The Bank of the United States was established by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale , and sought to open a branch in Boston . Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts , and Gore decided to make the move . He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank , and became a director of the Boston branch of the U . S . Bank . He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank , a relatively large investment . Gore was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch , and sought to merge state @ - @ chartered banks into the organization , arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service . Gore resigned from the board in 1794 , citing the demands of his law practice .
Gore ' s financial successes enabled him to join the elite society of Boston . In 1789 he purchased a large mansion on fashionable Bow ##d ##oin Square , and also bought a country estate in W ##alth ##am that grew over time to 300 acres ( 120 ha ) . He had a house built on the estate , most of which he operated as a gentleman farmer . He and other similarly @ - @ situated Federal ##ists formed the Massachusetts Society for Promot ##ing Agriculture , of which he served as a trustee for several years ; the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances in agriculture .
= = District attorney and diplomat = =
In 1789 President George Washington appointed Gore the first United States Attorney for Massachusetts as a reward for his support . Gore controversially refused to resign from the state legislature , arguing that the state constitution ' s prohib ##itions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts . He eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because of pressure from his fellow legislators .
Gore served as district attorney until 1796 . His principal matter of concern was the enforcement of U . S . neutrality with respect to the French Revolutionary Wars . He attempted several times to prosecute the French consul in Boston , Antoine Du ##pl ##aine , for arm ##ing and operating private ##ers out of the Port of Boston , but he was st ##ym ##ied by local j ##uries that sympath ##ized with the French . Du ##pl ##aine was eventually expelled on orders from President George Washington based on evidence provided by Gore .
Gore also promoted anti @ - @ French sentiment with political writings in Massachusetts newspapers . Writing under the pseudonym " Man ##l ##ius " , he denounced the formation of " Democratic Soc ##ieties " formed to oppose Federalist policy and support pro @ - @ French positions . He suggested to President Washington that someone be sent to England to negotiate with the British . John Jay traveled to London in 1794 and negotiated the Jay Treaty , whose ratification Gore voc ##ally supported . Although Gore was hostile to French policy , he was on friendly terms with individual French ##men : he hosted the future French statesman Tal ##ley ##rand when he visited the U . S .
In 1796 Washington appointed him as a commissioner representing the United States to handle maritime claims under the terms the Jay Treaty . As a result the G ##ores moved to England that year , establishing a residence in the fashionable Hyde Park area . The commission was established to arbit ##rate claims eman ##ating from British seizures of American vessels and cargo ##es , and from British claims relating to violations of American neutrality in the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars . It consisted of three Americans ( Gore , William Pink ##ney , and John Tr ##umb ##ull ) and two British commissioners ( John Nic ##oll and Nicholas Astley ) ; Tr ##umb ##ull was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently " fair @ - @ minded " to cast deciding votes in the event of disagreements . That year he was also elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .
Although Gore was well received by the British establishment , the work suffered from what Gore called a " tedious ##ness of process " , and he considered requesting a transfer in 1798 . In 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met , and the British stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway . Gore used this break to briefly return to America and assess the condition of his W ##alth ##am estate , where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in 1799 . After his return to London , with the commission work still stopped , he and Rebecca embarked on a tour of Europe . They visited Holland , Belgium , and Switzerland , and spent six months in Paris . During this trip , and later ones in England and Scotland , they took note of the architecture of country estates , and began planning a new house for their W ##alth ##am property .
The commission resumed its work in early 1802 , and had resolved all outstanding claims by August 1803 . It awarded $ 110 @ , @ 000 to British claim ##ants and over $ 6 million to American claim ##ants . The l ##ops ##ided result is due to the vastly larger number of American claims , but also to some key early decisions that favored American interpretations in the processing of the claims , and by a British administration that sought to remain in America ' s good gr ##aces .
The Gore ' s social circle in England revolved around his good friend Rufus King , who was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain in 1796 , along with other Massachusetts expatri ##ates . When King left his post in May 1803 he named Gore to head the London embassy as char ##gé d ' affair ##es . Although President Thomas Jefferson never issued a formal appointment , the British government accepted his role for the two @ - @ month interval between King ' s departure and the arrival of James Monroe as King ' s replacement . The G ##ores sailed for Boston in the spring of 1804 .
Rebecca Gore used their exposure to European country estates to design a lavish new building for their W ##alth ##am estate during their English so ##j ##ourn . Designed with the assistance of French architect Joseph @ - @ Guillaume Leg ##rand and probably also influenced by the works of English architect Sir John So ##ane , the house that was built upon their return to the United States in 1804 ( now known as Gore Place ) is one of the finest extant examples of Federalist architecture .
= = Law ##yer and state legisl ##ator = =
Soon after his return to the United States , Gore re ##ent ##ered state politics , winning election to the Massachusetts Senate . He was active in the state Federalist Party organization , sitting on its secret central committee . He resumed his law practice , in which he took on as a student Daniel Webster . One of the highest profile cases he took on was the 1807 defense of Thomas Self ##ridge , accused of murdering Charles Austin . Self ##ridge , an older Federalist attorney , had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from Austin ' s Republican father . In the politically charged atmosphere of the day in Boston , Self ##ridge , fearing for his own safety , had armed himself with a duel ##ing pistol . The younger Austin had , apparently on his own initiative , sought to beat Self ##ridge with a cane , and Self ##ridge fatally shot him in the encounter . Self ##ridge was prosecuted by Attorney General ( and future Gore gubernatorial opponent ) James Sullivan , and the defense also included arch @ - @ Federalist Harrison Gray Otis . Gore argued Self ##ridge acted in self @ - @ defense ; Self ##ridge was acquitted of murder by a jury whose for ##eman was Patriot and Federalist Paul Revere after fifteen minutes ' deliber ##ation .
Gore also resumed business activities upon his return . He invested in a wide variety of businesses and infrastructure , sp ##urring economic activity in the state . His investments ranged widely , including maritime insurance ( where is father @ - @ in @ - @ law had made his fortune ) , bridges , locks , canals , and textiles . He was a major investor in the Middlesex Canal , the Craig ##ie Bridge ( the first to connect Boston to Cambridge ) , and the Boston Manufacturing Company , whose factory proving the single @ - @ site production of textiles was in W ##alth ##am near his estate . Not all of his ventures panned out : the canal was in the long run a financial failure , as were efforts with other collaborators to develop L ##ech ##mere Point , the Cambridge side of the Craig ##ie Bridge . The textile mill , however , was a success , and Gore invested in the Mer ##rim ##ack Manufacturing Company . When it decided to locate in what is now Lowell , Massachusetts , Gore purchased shares in the P ##ropri ##et ##ors of L ##ocks and Can ##als , which operated ( and still owns today ) the Lowell canals .
In 1806 Gore won election to the State Senate . That year the Republicans were in the majority , and the election for governor was close enough to require a rec ##ount . The legislature scrut ##in ##ized the ballots in a partisan manner ( for example , retaining ballots containing miss ##p ##elled versions of Republican James Sullivan ' s name and disc ##ard ##ing similar ballots marked for Federalist Cal ##eb Strong ) . Gore and other Federal ##ists raised a public outcry , and the legislature relented , eventually cert ##ifying Strong as the winner .
Gore ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts in 1807 and 1808 against a rising tide of Republican ##ism in the state , losing both times to moderate Republican James Sullivan . The Federal ##ists gained control of the state legislature in 1808 in a backlash against Republican economic policies , but Gore was criticized for his failure to aggressively support state protests against the Em ##bar ##go Act of 1807 , which had a major negative effect on the state ' s large merchant fleet . Gore was in 1808 elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives , where he successfully led Federalist efforts to ensure the selection of a Federalist slate of presidential electors . He also spearheaded actions to drive Senator John Quincy Adams from the Federalist Party over his support of Thomas Jefferson ' s foreign policy . The legislature elected Adams ' successor nine months early , and gave Adams sufficiently distaste ##ful instructions that he resigned the post and joined with the Republicans .
= = Governor = =
Gore led the Federal ##ists to victory in 1809 against Sullivan ' s successor , Levi Lincoln , Sr . , who had taken over as acting governor upon Sullivan ' s death late in 1808 . During Gore ' s term the principal domestic issue occupying state politics was a banking crisis stimulated by the federal policy of emb ##ar ##going trade with Great Britain and France , then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars . Although the crisis caused a number of bank failures in New England , Massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed .
Foreign policy played a major role in Gore ' s administration . The legislature passed resolves opposing the federal government ' s hard ##line policy against trade and diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom ( then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars ) , and Gore in early 1810 invited Francis James Jackson , who had been rejected as the UK ' s ambassador to the US , to visit the state . This pressure may have played a role in President James Madison ' s decision to renew relations with the UK and accept Jackson ' s credentials .
The less ##ening of the war threat , and the choice by the Republicans of the popular El ##bridge Gerry as their candidate brought a challenge to Federalist control of Massachusetts in the 1810 elections . The un ##ost ##ent ##at ##ious Gerry and Republican partisans criticized Gore for his lavish lifestyle , including his pal ##at ##ial W ##alth ##am residence and pomp ##ous activities he organized as governor , and highlighted his Loyalist family connections while emphasizing Gerry ' s unim ##pe ##ach ##able patriotism . Gerry won the election . Jackson did visit Boston , but he was greeted not by Gore , but Gerry . Gore ran against Gerry again in 1811 , but lost in another ac ##rim ##on ##ious campaign .
Gore was granted an honorary law degree from Harvard in 1809 . He served on the college ' s Board of O ##verse ##ers from 1810 to 1815 and as a Fellow from 1816 to 1820 . Harvard ' s first library building , a Gothic structure built in 1838 of Quincy granite , was named in his honor , but was demolished when Wid ##ener Library was built in its place in 1915 . ( This structure is found on the seal of the city of Cambridge . ) One of the residential Winthrop House ' s buildings is called Gore Hall in his honor .

In the spring of 1813 , he was appointed by Governor Cal ##eb Strong to fill the U . S . Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Senator James Lloyd . He served from May 5 , 1813 to May 30 , 1816 , winning reelection to the seat in 1814 . He opposed the ongoing War of 1812 in these years , with his earlier diplomatic experience providing valuable knowledge to Federalist interests . He expressed approval of the 1814 Hartford Convention in which the New England states aired grievances concerning Republican governance of the country and the conduct of the war .
Gore ass ##ented to the Treaty of G ##hent that ended the war , but was unhappy that the nation had not gained anything from the war . He resigned in June 1816 , unhappy with the politics of Washington and suffering from poor health . Although he was no longer active in politics , he continued to express opinions on the subjects of the day , opposing the 1820 Missouri Compromise and bem ##oan ##ing the " great moder ##ation & med ##i ##ocr ##ity " of Federalist Governor John Brooks .

Gore remained active in the administration of Harvard , and was active in a number of organizations , including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society ( whose president he was from 1806 to 1818 ) . He was also elected a member of the American Antiqu ##arian Society in 1814 . Gore spent most of his later years at his country estate in W ##alth ##am , suffering from worsening r ##he ##um ##at ##oid arthritis that made walking increasingly difficult . His declining health and lack of social scene in W ##alth ##am led him in 1822 to return to Boston in the winters . He died on March 1 , 1827 in Boston and is buried in its Gran ##ary Bury ##ing Ground .
Gore ' s wife died in 1834 ; the couple had no children . The major benefic ##iary of the Gore estate was Harvard ( which received an estimated $ 100 @ , @ 000 ) , although bequ ##ests were also made to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society . The W ##alth ##am estate passed through several hands and was subdivided over time . The mansion was saved from demolition by the Gore Place Society ( established for the purpose of preserving it ) , which now operates it as a museum . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970 .
= Nero =
Nero ( / ˈ ##n ##ɪ ##ə ##ro ##ʊ / ; Latin : Ner ##ō Claudius Caesar Augustus German ##icus ; 15 December 37 AD – 9 June 68 AD ) was Roman Emperor from 54 to 68 , and the last in the Julio @ - @ Claud ##ian dynasty . Nero was adopted by his grand @ - @ uncle Claudius to become his heir and successor , and succeeded to the throne in 54 following Claudius ' death .
Nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy , trade and enhancing the cultural life of the empire , but according to the historian Tac ##itus he was viewed by the Roman people as compuls ##ive and corrupt . He ordered theatres built and promoted athletic games . During his reign , the redoubt ##able general Cor ##bul ##o conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the Parthian Empire . His general Su ##eton ##ius Paul ##inus crushed a revolt in Britain . Nero annexed the Bos ##por ##an Kingdom to the empire and began the First Jewish – Roman War .
In 64 AD , most of Rome was destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome , which many Romans believed Nero himself had started in order to clear land for his planned pal ##at ##ial complex , the Dom ##us A ##ure ##a . In 68 , the rebellion of Vind ##ex in Gaul and later the acc ##lamation of Gal ##ba in Hisp ##ania drove Nero from the throne . Facing a false report of being denounced as a public enemy who was to be executed , he committed suicide on 9 June 68 ( the first Roman emperor to do so ) . His death ended the Julio @ - @ Claud ##ian dynasty , sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the Year of the Four Em ##perors . Nero ' s rule is often associated with tyr ##anny and extravag ##ance . He is known for many executions , including that of his mother , and the probable murder by poison of his step ##bro ##ther Britann ##icus .
Nero was rumored to have had captured Christians d ##ipped in oil and set on fire in his garden at night as a source of light . This view is based on the writings of Tac ##itus , Su ##eton ##ius and Cass ##ius Dio , the main surviving sources for Nero ' s reign , but a few surviving sources paint Nero in a more favourable light . Some sources , including some mentioned above , portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people , especially in the East . Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on Nero ' s tyrann ##ical acts .
= = Early life = =
= = = Family = = =
Lucius Dom ##it ##ius A ##hen ##obar ##bus , Nero , was born on 15 December 37 in Ant ##ium ( modern An ##zio and N ##ett ##uno ) , near Rome . He was the only son of G ##naeus Dom ##it ##ius A ##hen ##obar ##bus and Agripp ##ina the Younger , sister of Emperor Caligula .
Nero ' s father , G ##naeus , was the son of Lucius Dom ##it ##ius A ##hen ##obar ##bus ( consul 16 BC ) and Ant ##onia Major . G ##naeus was thus the grandson of G ##naeus Dom ##it ##ius A ##hen ##obar ##bus ( consul 32 BC ) and probably A ##em ##ilia Lep ##ida on his father ' s side , and the grandson of Mark Antony and Oct ##avia Minor on his mother ' s side . Thus , Nero had as his paternal grandmother Ant ##onia Major , and also claimed more remote descent from Ant ##onia Minor as a great @ - @ grandson — later grandson after Claudius adopted him .
Through Oct ##avia , Nero was the great @ - @ nephew of Caesar Augustus . Nero ' s father had been employed as a pra ##et ##or and was a member of Caligula ' s staff when the latter travelled to the East ( some apparently think Su ##eton ##ius refers to Augustus ' s adopted son Gaius Caesar here , but this is not likely ) .
Nero ' s father was described by Su ##eton ##ius as a murderer and a cheat who was charged by Emperor Tiberius with treason , adultery and incest . Tiberius died , allowing him to escape these charges . Nero ' s father died of ed ##ema ( " drop ##sy " ) in 39 when Nero was two .
Nero ' s mother was Agripp ##ina the Younger , a great @ - @ granddaughter of Caesar Augustus and his wife Scrib ##onia through their daughter Julia the Elder and her husband Marcus V ##ips ##an ##ius Agripp ##a . Agripp ##ina ' s father , German ##icus , was a grandson of Augustus ' s wife , L ##ivia , on one side and to Mark Antony and Oct ##avia on the other . German ##icus ' mother Ant ##onia Minor , was a daughter of Oct ##avia Minor and Mark Antony . Oct ##avia was Augustus ' elder sister . German ##icus was also the adopted son of Tiberius . Agripp ##ina poisoned her second husband Pass ##ien ##us Crisp ##us , so many ancient historians also accuse her of murdering her third husband , the emperor Claudius .
= = = Ancestry and family = = =
= = = Rise to power = = =
Nero was not expected to become Emperor because his maternal uncle , Caligula , had begun his reign at the age of 24 with enough time to produce his own heir . Nero ' s mother , Agripp ##ina , lost favour with Caligula and was exiled in 39 after her husband ' s death . Caligula seized Nero ' s inheritance and sent him to be brought up by his less wealthy aunt , Dom ##itia Lep ##ida , who was the mother of Val ##eria Mess ##al ##ina , Claudius ' s third wife . Caligula , his wife Caes ##onia and their infant daughter Julia Dr ##us ##illa were murdered on 24 January 41 . These events led Claudius , Caligula ' s uncle , to become emperor . Claudius allowed Agripp ##ina to return from exile .
Claudius had married twice before marrying Val ##eria Mess ##al ##ina . His previous marriages produced three children including a son , Dr ##us ##us , who died at a young age . He had two children with Mess ##al ##ina – Claudia Oct ##avia ( born 40 ) and Britann ##icus ( born 41 ) . Mess ##al ##ina was executed by Claudius in the year 48 .
In 49 AD , Claudius married a fourth time , to Nero ' s mother Agripp ##ina , despite her being his niece . To aid Claudius politically , young Nero was adopted in 50 and took the name Nero Claudius Caesar Dr ##us ##us German ##icus ( see adoption in Rome ) . Nero was older than his step ##bro ##ther Britann ##icus , and thus became heir to the throne .
Nero was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14 . He was appointed proc ##ons ##ul , entered and first addressed the Senate , made joint public appearances with Claudius , and was featured in coinage . In 53 , he married his steps ##ister Claudia Oct ##avia .

= = = Early rule = = =
Claudius died in 54 and Nero , taking the name Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus German ##icus , was established as Emperor . Though accounts vary , many ancient historians state Agripp ##ina poisoned Claudius . According to Pliny the Elder , she used poison mushrooms . It is not known how much Nero knew or if he was even involved in the death of Claudius .
Su ##eton ##ius wrote " . . . for even if he was not the inst ##igator of the emperor ' s death , he was at least priv ##y to it , as he openly admitted ; for he used afterwards to laud mushrooms , the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius , as " the food of the gods , " as the Greek pro ##ver ##b has it . At any rate , after Claudius ' death he v ##ented on him every kind of insult , in act and word , charging him now with f ##olly and now with cruelty ; for it was a favourite joke of his to say that Claudius had ceased " to play the fool " among mort ##als , l ##engthening the first syllable of the word mor ##ari , and he disregarded many of his decrees and acts as the work of a mad ##man and a dot ##ard . Finally , he neglected to encl ##ose the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall . "
According to Su ##eton ##ius ; Nero became Emperor at the age of 17 when the news of Claudius ' death was made known , making him the youngest emperor at that time Although , what Su ##eton ##ius may have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth , also listed by Su ##eton ##ius , would have made him 16 at the time of Claudius ' death . Tac ##itus , in book XIII of his Annals , describes Nero as being ' scarcely out of his boy ##hood ' at the time he became emperor . Ancient historians describe Nero ' s early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother , Agripp ##ina , his tutor Lucius Anna ##eus Seneca , and the Pra ##et ##orian Pre ##fect S ##ext ##us Af ##ran ##ius Burr ##us , especially in the first year . Other t ##utors were less often mentioned , such as Alexander of A ##eg ##ae .
Very early in Nero ' s rule , problems arose from competition for influence between Agripp ##ina and Nero ' s two main advisers , Seneca and Burr ##us . Agripp ##ina also attempted to influence the young Nero . Agripp ##ina also is mentioned by ancient sources as " sc ##he ##ming for her son ( Nero ) " . This sc ##he ##ming continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them . It is extremely unusual to see a women ' s face on a coin in the ancient world . It is because of this position of power Agripp ##ina felt jealous as Seneca in particular rose up in Nero ' s court as he offered the advice Nero wanted to hear unlike his mother .
In 54 , Agripp ##ina tried to sit down next to Nero while he met with an Armenian envoy , but Seneca stopped her and prevented a scandal ##ous scene ( as it was unim ##ag ##in ##able at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business ) . Nero ' s friends also mist ##rusted Agripp ##ina and told Nero to be ##ware of his mother .
Nero was reportedly unsatisf ##ied with his marriage to Oct ##avia and entered into an affair with Claudia Act ##e , a former slave . In 55 , Agripp ##ina attempted to intervene in favor of Oct ##avia and demanded that her son dismiss Act ##e . Nero , with the support of Seneca , resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs .
With Agripp ##ina ' s influence over her son severed , she reportedly began pushing for Britann ##icus , Nero ' s step ##bro ##ther , to become emperor . Nearly fourteen @ - @ year @ - @ old Britann ##icus , heir @ - @ designate prior to Nero ' s adoption , was still legally a minor , but was approaching legal adulthood . According to Tac ##itus , Agripp ##ina hoped that with her support , Britann ##icus , being the blood son of Claudius , would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over Nero . However , the youth died suddenly and suspic ##iously on 12 February 55 , the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set .
Nero claimed that Britann ##icus died from an epile ##ptic seizure , but ancient historians all claim Britann ##icus ' death came from Nero ' s poisoning him . Supp ##osed ##ly , he enlisted the services of Locust ##a , a woman who specialized in the manufacture of po ##isons . She devised a mixture to kill Britann ##icus , but after testing it unsuccessfully on a slave , Nero angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable . Locust ##a then devised a new conc ##o ##ction that she promised would " kill sw ##if ##ter than a v ##iper . "
Her promise was fulfilled after Britann ##icus consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine , which had already been t ##asted , and succumbed within minutes . After the death of Britann ##icus , Agripp ##ina was accused of s ##land ##ering Oct ##avia and Nero ordered her out of the imperial residence .
= = = Mat ##ric ##ide and consolidation of power = = =
Over time , Nero became progressively more powerful , freeing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne . In 55 , he removed Marcus Anton ##ius Pallas , an ally of Agripp ##ina , from his position in the treasury . Pallas , along with Burr ##us , was accused of consp ##iring against the Emperor to bring Faust ##us Sull ##a to the throne . Seneca was accused of having relations with Agripp ##ina and emb ##e ##zz ##lement . Seneca succeeded in having himself , Pallas and Burr ##us acquitted . According to Cass ##ius Dio , at this time , Seneca and Burr ##us reduced their role in governing from careful management to mere moder ##ation of Nero .
In 58 , Nero became romantically involved with Pop ##pa ##ea Sab ##ina , the wife of his friend and future emperor Oth ##o . Reported ##ly because a marriage to Pop ##pa ##ea and a divorce from Oct ##avia did not seem politically feasible with Agripp ##ina alive , Nero ordered the murder of his mother in 59 . A number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as Nero did not marry Pop ##pa ##ea until 62 .
Additionally , according to Su ##eton ##ius , Pop ##pa ##ea did not divorce her husband until after Agripp ##ina ' s death , making it unlikely that the already married Pop ##pa ##ea would be pressing Nero for marriage . Some modern historians theor ##ize that Nero ' s execution of Agripp ##ina was prompted by her plotting to set Rub ##ell ##ius Pl ##aut ##us on the throne . According to Su ##eton ##ius , Nero tried to kill his mother through a shipwreck planned by his freed ##man tutor An ##ic ##etus . Instead , it took the life of Agripp ##ina ' s friend , Ac ##er ##ron ##ia Poll ##a . When Agripp ##ina survived , he had her executed by An ##ic ##etus and framed it as a suicide . The incident is also recorded by Tac ##itus .
In 62 , Nero ' s adviser , Burr ##us , died . Additionally , Seneca was again faced with emb ##e ##zz ##lement charges . Seneca asked Nero for permission to retire from public affairs . Nero divorced and banished Oct ##avia on grounds of infer ##t ##ility , leaving him free to marry the pregnant Pop ##pa ##ea . After public protests , Nero was forced to allow Oct ##avia to return from exile , but she was executed shortly after her return .
Nero also was reported to have kicked Pop ##pa ##ea to death in 65 before she could have his second child . However , modern historians , noting Su ##eton ##ius , Tac ##itus and Cass ##ius Dio ' s possible bias against Nero and the likelihood that they did not have eyewitness accounts of private events , post ##ulate that Pop ##pa ##ea may have died because of complications of miscarriage or childbirth .
Acc ##us ##ations of treason being plotted against Nero and the Senate first appeared in 62 . The Senate ruled that Ant ##ist ##ius , a pra ##et ##or , should be put to death for speaking ill of Nero at a party . Later , Nero ordered the exile of Fab ##ric ##ius Ve ##iento who s ##land ##ered the Senate in a book . Tac ##itus writes that the roots of the conspiracy led by Gaius Cal ##p ##urn ##ius P ##iso began in this year . To consolidate power , Nero executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pallas , Rub ##ell ##ius Pl ##aut ##us and Faust ##us Sull ##a . According to Su ##eton ##ius , Nero " showed neither discrimination nor moder ##ation in putting to death whom ##soever he pleased " during this period .
Nero ' s consolidation of power also included a slow usur ##ping of authority from the Senate . In 54 , Nero promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule . By 65 , senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the P ##ison ##ian conspiracy .

When Nero ' s wife Pop ##pa ##ea Sab ##ina died in 65 , Nero went into deep mourning . Her body was not cremated , it was stuffed with spices , emb ##al ##med and put in the M ##ausoleum of Augustus . She was given a state funeral . Nero praised her during the funeral eulogy and gave her divine honors . It is said that Nero " burned ten years ' worth of Arabia ' s inc ##ense production at her funeral .
In the beginning of 66 , he married Stat ##ilia Mess ##al ##ina . She was already married when she became Nero ' s mistress in 65 AD , with Stat ##ilia ' s husband being driven to suicide in 66 , so Nero could marry Stat ##ilia . She was one of the few of Nero ' s court ##iers who survived the fall of his reign .
In 67 , Nero ordered a young freed ##man , Sp ##orus , to be cast ##rated and then married him . According to Dion Cass ##ius , Sp ##orus bore an unc ##anny resemblance to Sab ##ina , and Nero even called him by his dead wife ' s name .

Over the course of his reign , Nero often made rulings that pleased the lower class . Nero was criticized as being obsessed with personal popularity .
Nero began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy . In this first year , he forbade others to refer to him with regard to enact ##ments , for which he was praised by the Senate . Nero was known for spending his time visiting brothel ##s and t ##aver ##ns during this period .
In 55 , Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator . He was consul four times between 55 and 60 . During this period , some ancient historians speak fairly well of Nero and contrast it with his later rule .
Under Nero , restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines . Also , fees for lawyers were limited . There was a discussion in the Senate on the misconduct of the freed ##men class , and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right of rev ##oking freedom . Nero supported the freed ##men and ruled that patrons had no such right .
The Senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household . Despite riots from the people , Nero supported the Senate on their measure , and deployed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law . However , he vetoed strong measures against the freed ##men affected by the case .
After tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor , Nero transferred collection authority to lower commissioners . Nero banned any magistrate or proc ##ur ##ator from exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace . Additionally , there were many impe ##ach ##ments and remov ##als of government officials along with arrests for extortion and corruption .
When further complaints arose that the poor were being overly tax ##ed , Nero attempted to repeal all indirect taxes . The Senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury . As a compromise , taxes were cut from 4 @ . @ 5 % to 2 @ . @ 5 % . Additionally , secret government tax records were ordered to become public . To lower the cost of food imports , merchant ships were declared tax @ - @ exempt .
In imitation of the Greeks , Nero built a number of gymnasium ##s and theatres . En ##orm ##ous gladi ##atorial shows were also held . Nero also established the qu ##inqu ##ennial Ner ##onia . The festival included games , poetry , and theater . Historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to imm ##or ##ality . Others considered that to have performers dressed in Greek clothing was old fashioned . Some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment .
In 64 , Rome burned . Nero enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction . A number of other major construction projects occurred in Nero ' s late reign . Nero had the marshes of Ost ##ia filled with rubble from the fire . He erected the large Dom ##us A ##ure ##a . In 67 , Nero attempted to have a canal dug at the Isthmus of Corinth . Ancient historians state that these projects and others exacerbated the drain on the State ' s budget .
The cost to rebuild Rome was immense , requiring funds the state treasury did not have . Nero dev ##al ##ued the Roman currency for the first time in the Empire ' s history . He reduced the weight of the den ##arius from 84 per Roman pound to 96 ( 3 @ . @ 85 grams to 3 @ . @ 35 grams ) . He also reduced the silver purity from 99 @ . @ 5 % to 93 @ . @ 5 % — the silver weight dropping from 3 @ . @ 83 grams to 3 @ . @ 4 grams . Furthermore , Nero reduced the weight of the a ##ure ##us from 40 per Roman pound to 45 ( 8 grams to 7 @ . @ 2 grams ) .
Between 62 and 67 , according to Pl ##in ##ius the Elder and Seneca , Nero promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile River . It was the first exploration of equatorial Africa from Europe in history . However , Nero ' s expedition up the Nile failed upon reaching the im ##pen ##et ##rable S ##udd of present @ - @ day South Sudan .
The economic policy of Nero is a point of debate among scholars . According to ancient historians , Nero ' s construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of expenditures under Nero left Italy " thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money " with " the provinces ruined . " Modern historians , though , note that the period was ridd ##led with defl ##ation and that it is likely that Nero ' s spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles .
= = = Great Fire of Rome ( 64 AD ) = = =
The Great Fire of Rome erupted on the night of 18 July to 19 July 64 . The fire started at the southeastern end of the Circus Maximus in shops selling flamm ##able goods .
The extent of the fire is uncertain . According to Tac ##itus , who was nine at the time of the fire , it spread quickly and burned for over five days . It destroyed three of fourteen Roman districts and severely damaged seven . The only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is Pliny the Elder , who wrote about it in passing . Other historians who lived through the period ( including Joseph ##us , Dio Chrys ##ost ##om , Plutarch and Ep ##ict ##etus ) make no mention of it in what remains of their work .
It is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire — whether accident or arson . Su ##eton ##ius and Cass ##ius Dio favor Nero as the arson ##ist , so he could build a pal ##at ##ial complex . Tac ##itus mentions that Christians confessed to the crime , but it is not known whether these conf ##essions were induced by torture . However , accidental fires were common in ancient Rome . In fact , Rome suffered other large fires in 69 and in 80 .
It was said by Su ##eton ##ius and Cass ##ius Dio that Nero sang the " Sack of Il ##ium " in stage costume while the city burned . Popular legend claims that Nero played the f ##iddle at the time of the fire , an an ##achron ##ism based merely on the concept of the ly ##re , a string ##ed instrument associated with Nero and his performances . ( The f ##iddle was not invented until the 10th century . ) Tac ##itus ' s account , however , has Nero in Ant ##ium at the time of the fire . Tac ##itus also said that Nero playing his ly ##re and singing while the city burned was only rumor .
According to Tac ##itus , upon hearing news of the fire , Nero returned to Rome to organize a relief effort , which he paid for from his own funds . Nero ' s contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the blaze , spending days searching the debris without even his body ##guards . After the fire , Nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless , and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors .
In the wake of the fire , he made a new urban development plan . Houses after the fire were spaced out , built in brick , and faced by port ##icos on wide roads . Nero also built a new palace complex known as the Dom ##us A ##ure ##a in an area cleared by the fire . This included lush artificial landscapes and a 30 @ - @ meter @ - @ tall statue of himself , the Coloss ##us of Nero . The size of this complex is debated ( from 100 to 300 acres ) . To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction , tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire .
Tac ##itus , in one of the earliest non @ - @ Christian references to the origins of Christianity , notes that the population searched for a scap ##eg ##oat and rumors held Nero responsible . To defl ##ect blame , Nero targeted Christians . He ordered Christians to be thrown to dogs , while others were cruc ##ified and burned .
= = = Public performances = = =
Nero enjoyed driving a one @ - @ horse chariot , singing to the ly ##re and poetry . He even composed songs that were performed by other entertain ##ers throughout the empire . At first , Nero only performed for a private audience .
In 64 AD . , Nero began singing in public in Ne ##apolis in order to improve his popularity . He also sang at the second qu ##inqu ##ennial Ner ##onia in 65 . It was said that Nero cr ##aved the attention , but historians also write that Nero was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his inner circle and the people . Ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform , calling it shame ##ful .
Nero was persuaded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance . As a competitor , Nero raced a ten @ - @ horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it . He also performed as an actor and a singer . Though Nero fal ##tered in his racing ( in one case , dropping out entirely before the end ) and acting competitions , he won these crowns nevertheless and par ##aded them when he returned to Rome . The victories are attributed to Nero b ##ribing the judges and his status as emperor .
= = = War and peace with Par ##thia = = =
Shortly after Nero ' s accession to the throne in 54 , the Roman vassal kingdom of Armenia overth ##rew their Iberian prince Rh ##ad ##am ##ist ##us and he was replaced with the Parthian prince Tir ##idates . This was seen as a Parthian invasion of Roman territory . There was concern in Rome over how the young Emperor would handle the situation . Nero reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of G ##naeus Dom ##it ##ius Cor ##bul ##o . The Parth ##ians temporarily relinquished control of Armenia to Rome .
The peace did not last and full @ - @ scale war broke out in 58 . The Parthian king V ##olog ##ases I refused to remove his brother Tir ##idates from Armenia . The Parth ##ians began a full @ - @ scale invasion of the Armenian kingdom . Commander Cor ##bul ##o responded and repelled most of the Parthian army that same year . Tir ##idates retreated and Rome again controlled most of Armenia .
Nero was acclaimed in public for this initial victory . T ##igr ##anes , a Capp ##ad ##oc ##ian noble raised in Rome , was installed by Nero as the new ruler of Armenia . Cor ##bul ##o was appointed governor of Syria as a reward .
In 62 , T ##igr ##anes invaded the Parthian province of Adi ##ab ##ene . Again , Rome and Par ##thia were at war and this continued until 63 . Par ##thia began building up for a strike against the Roman province of Syria . Cor ##bul ##o tried to convince Nero to continue the war , but Nero opted for a peace deal instead . There was anxiety in Rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit .
The result was a deal where Tir ##idates again became the Armenian king , but was crowned in Rome by Emperor Nero . In the future , the king of Armenia was to be a Parthian prince , but his appointment required approval from the Romans . Tir ##idates was forced to come to Rome and part ##ake in ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance .
This peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory for Nero politically . Nero became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the Parth ##ians as well . The peace between Par ##thia and Rome lasted 50 years until Emperor Tra ##jan of Rome invaded Armenia in 114 .
= = = Other major power struggles and rebellions = = =
The war with Par ##thia was not Nero ' s only major war but he was both criticized and praised for an av ##ersion to battle . Like many emperors , Nero faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire .
British Revolt of 60 – 61 ( Boud ##ica ' s Uprising )
In 60 , a major rebellion broke out in the province of Britannia . While the governor Gaius Su ##eton ##ius Paul ##inus and his troops were busy capturing the island of Mona ( Anglesey ) from the dru ##ids , the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queen Boud ##ica of the I ##c ##eni . Boud ##ica and her troops destroyed three cities before the army of Paul ##inus could return , receive reinforcements , and quell the rebellion in 61 . Fearing Paul ##inus himself would provoke further rebellion , Nero replaced him with the more passive Publ ##ius Pet ##ron ##ius Tur ##p ##ilian ##us .
The P ##ison ##ian Conspiracy of 65
In 65 , Gaius Cal ##p ##urn ##ius P ##iso , a Roman statesman , organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Sub ##ri ##us Fl ##av ##us and Sul ##p ##ic ##ius As ##per , a trib ##une and a cent ##ur ##ion of the Pra ##et ##orian Guard . According to Tac ##itus , many conspirators wished to " rescue the state " from the emperor and restore the Republic . The freed ##man Mil ##ich ##us discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero ' s secretary , Ep ##aph ##rod ##it ##os . As a result , the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including Lucan , the poet . Nero ' s previous advisor , Seneca was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators .

In 66 , there was a Jewish revolt in Jud ##ea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension . In 67 , Nero dispatched Vespasian to restore order . This revolt was eventually put down in 70 , after Nero ' s death . This revolt is famous for Romans bre ##aching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem .
= = = The revolt of Vind ##ex and Gal ##ba and the death of Nero = = =
In March 68 , Gaius Julius Vind ##ex , the governor of Gall ##ia Lug ##d ##un ##ensis , rebelled against Nero ' s tax policies . Lucius Ver ##gin ##ius Rufus , the governor of Germania Superior , was ordered to put down Vind ##ex ' s rebellion . In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province , Vind ##ex called upon Serv ##ius Sul ##p ##ic ##ius Gal ##ba , the governor of Hisp ##ania Tarr ##acon ##ensis , to join the rebellion and further , to declare himself emperor in opposition to Nero .
At the Battle of Ves ##ont ##io in May 68 , Ver ##gin ##ius ' forces easily defeated those of Vind ##ex and the latter committed suicide . However , after putting down this one rebel , Ver ##gin ##ius ' legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor . Ver ##gin ##ius refused to act against Nero , but the discontent of the legions of Germany and the continued opposition of Gal ##ba in Spain did not b ##ode well for him .
While Nero had retained some control of the situation , support for Gal ##ba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy . The prefect of the Pra ##et ##orian Guard , Gaius N ##ymph ##id ##ius Sab ##inus , also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for Gal ##ba .
In response , Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of Ost ##ia and , from there , to take a fleet to one of the still @ - @ loyal eastern provinces . According to Su ##eton ##ius , Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands , responding with a line from Ver ##gil ' s A ##ene ##id : " Is it so dreadful a thing then to die ? " Nero then toy ##ed with the idea of fleeing to Par ##thia , throwing himself upon the mercy of Gal ##ba , or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences " and if he could not soft ##en their hearts , to ent ##reat them at least to allow him the pre ##fecture of Egypt " . Su ##eton ##ius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero ' s writing desk , but that he d ##ared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum .
Nero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace . After sleeping , he a ##wo ##ke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left . Disp ##atch ##ing messages to his friends ' palace chambers for them to come , he received no answers . Upon going to their chambers personally , he found them all abandoned . When he called for a gladi ##ator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him , no one appeared . He cried , " Have I neither friend nor foe ? " and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber .
Returning , Nero sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts . An imperial freed ##man , Ph ##a ##on , offered his villa , located 4 miles outside the city . Trav ##elling in disguise , Nero and four loyal freed ##men , Ep ##aph ##rod ##it ##os , Ph ##a ##on , Ne ##ophy ##t ##us , and Sp ##orus , reached the villa , where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him .
At this time , a courier arrived with a report that the Senate had declared Nero a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the Forum . The Senate actually was still reluctant and deliber ##ating on the right course of action as Nero was the last member of the Julio @ - @ Claud ##ian Family . Indeed , most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the de ##ified blood ##line , if not to Nero himself . The men actually had the goal of returning Nero back to the Senate , where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with the reb ##elling governors that would preserve Nero ' s life , so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced .
Nero , however , did not know this , and at the news brought by the courier , he prepared himself for suicide , pacing up and down mut ##tering " Qual ##is artif ##ex pere ##o " which translates to English as " What an artist dies in me . " L ##osing his nerve , he first begged for one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself . At last , the sound of approaching horsemen drove Nero to face the end . However , he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary , Ep ##aph ##rod ##it ##os , to perform the task .
When one of the horsemen entered , upon his seeing Nero all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain . Nero ' s final words were " Too late ! This is fidelity ! " He died on 9 June 68 , the anniversary of the death of Oct ##avia , and was buried in the M ##ausoleum of the Dom ##it ##ii A ##hen ##obar ##bi , in what is now the Villa Borg ##he ##se ( P ##inc ##ian Hill ) area of Rome .
With his death , the Julio @ - @ Claud ##ian dynasty ended . The Senate , when news of his death reached Rome , posthumously declared Nero a public enemy to appease the coming Gal ##ba ( as the Senate had initially declared Gal ##ba as a public enemy ) and proclaimed Gal ##ba the new emperor . Chaos would ens ##ue in the year of the Four Em ##perors .
= = = Post mort ##em = = =
According to Su ##eton ##ius and Cass ##ius Dio , the people of Rome celebrated the death of Nero . Tac ##itus , though , describes a more complicated political environment . Tac ##itus mentions that Nero ' s death was welcomed by Senators , nobility and the upper class . The lower @ - @ class , slaves , frequent ##ers of the arena and the theater , and " those who were supported by the famous excess ##es of Nero " , on the other hand , were upset with the news . Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings , as they had allegiance to Nero , but were b ##ribed to overthrow him .
Eastern sources , namely Phil ##ost ##r ##atus II and Apoll ##onius of Ty ##ana , mention that Nero ' s death was mour ##ned as he " restored the liberties of Hell ##as with a wisdom and moder ##ation quite alien to his character " and that he " held our liberties in his hand and respected them . "
Modern scholarship generally holds that , while the Senate and more well @ - @ off individuals welcomed Nero ' s death , the general populace was " loyal to the end and beyond , for Oth ##o and Vit ##ell ##ius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia . "
Nero ' s name was erased from some monuments , in what Edward Cham ##pl ##in regards as an " out ##burst of private zeal " . Many portraits of Nero were reworked to represent other figures ; according to Eric R . Var ##ner , over fifty such images survive . This rework ##ing of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgr ##aced emperors was condemned posthumously ( see damn ##atio memor ##iae ) . Cham ##pl ##in , however , doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of Nero long after his death .
The civil war during the year of the Four Em ##perors was described by ancient historians as a troub ##ling period . According to Tac ##itus , this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial blood ##line , as Nero and those before him could . Gal ##ba began his short reign with the execution of many allies of Nero and possible future enemies . One such notable enemy included N ##ymph ##id ##ius Sab ##inus , who claimed to be the son of Emperor Caligula .
Oth ##o overth ##rew Gal ##ba . Oth ##o was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of Nero ' s and resembled him somewhat in temperament . It was said that the common Roman hailed Oth ##o as Nero himself . Oth ##o used " Nero " as a surname and re ##er ##ected many statues to Nero . Vit ##ell ##ius overth ##rew Oth ##o . Vit ##ell ##ius began his reign with a large funeral for Nero complete with songs written by Nero .
After Nero ' s suicide in 68 , there was a widespread belief , especially in the eastern provinces , that he was not dead and somehow would return . This belief came to be known as the Nero Red ##iv ##iv ##us Legend .
The legend of Nero ' s return lasted for hundreds of years after Nero ' s death . Augustine of Hipp ##o wrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422 .
At least three Nero imp ##ost ##ers emerged leading rebellions . The first , who sang and played the c ##ith ##ara or ly ##re and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor , appeared in 69 during the reign of Vit ##ell ##ius . After persuading some to recognize him , he was captured and executed . Sometime during the reign of Titus ( 79 – 81 ) , another imp ##ost ##or appeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of the ly ##re and looked like Nero but he , too , was killed . Twenty years after Nero ' s death , during the reign of Domitian , there was a third pret ##ender . He was supported by the Parth ##ians , who only reluctantly gave him up , and the matter almost came to war .
= = Physical appearance = =
In his book The Lives of the Twelve Caes ##ars , Su ##eton ##ius describes Nero as " about the average height , his body marked with spots and mal ##od ##orous , his hair light blonde , his features regular rather than attractive , his eyes blue and somewhat weak , his neck over thick , his belly prominent , and his legs very slender . "
= = Histor ##iography = =
The history of Nero ' s reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with Nero . These first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and fant ##ast ##ical , either overly critical or praising of Nero . The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events . Nonetheless , these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians . A few of the contemporary historians are known by name . Fab ##ius Rust ##icus , Cl ##uv ##ius Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on Nero that are now lost . There were also pro @ - @ Nero histories , but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised .
The bulk of what is known of Nero comes from Tac ##itus , Su ##eton ##ius and Cass ##ius Dio , who were all of the sen ##atorial class . Tac ##itus and Su ##eton ##ius wrote their histories on Nero over fifty years after his death , while Cass ##ius Dio wrote his history over 150 years after Nero ' s death . These sources contradict on a number of events in Nero ' s life including the death of Claudius , the death of Agripp ##ina , and the Roman fire of 64 , but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero .
A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on Nero . Few surviving sources paint Nero in a favourable light . Some sources , though , portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people , especially in the east .
Cass ##ius Dio
Cass ##ius Dio ( c . 155 – 229 ) was the son of Cass ##ius Apr ##onian ##us , a Roman senator . He passed the greater part of his life in public service . He was a senator under Comm ##odus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Sept ##im ##ius Sever ##us ; and afterwards suff ##ect consul around 205 , and also proc ##ons ##ul in Africa and P ##ann ##onia .
Books 61 – 63 of Dio ' s Roman History describe the reign of Nero . Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abrid ##ged and altered by John X ##iph ##il ##inus , an 11th @ - @ century monk .
Dio Chrys ##ost ##om
Dio Chrys ##ost ##om ( c . 40 – 120 ) , a Greek philosopher and historian , wrote the Roman people were very happy with Nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely . They long ##ed for his rule once he was gone and embraced imp ##ost ##ers when they appeared :
Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet ; for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned , there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time , seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive . And the great majority do believe that he still is , although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive .
Ep ##ict ##etus
Ep ##ict ##etus ( c . 55 – 135 ) was the slave to Nero ' s sc ##ribe Ep ##aph ##rod ##it ##os . He makes a few passing negative comments on Nero ' s character in his work , but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule . He describes Nero as a spoiled , angry and unhappy man .
Joseph ##us
The historian Joseph ##us ( c . 37 – 100 ) , while calling Nero a tyrant , was also the first to mention bias against Nero . Of other historians , he said :
But I o ##mit any further discourse about these affairs ; for there have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero ; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour , as having received benefits from him ; while others , out of hatred to him , and the great ill @ - @ will which they bore him , have so imp ##ud ##ently r ##aved against him with their lies , that they just ##ly deserve to be condemned . Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of Nero , since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time , even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred , since those writers lived a long time after them .
Lucan
Though more of a poet than historian , Luc ##anus ( c . 39 – 65 ) has one of the kind ##est accounts of Nero ' s rule . He writes of peace and prosperity under Nero in contrast to previous war and strife . Ironically , he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow Nero and was executed .
Phil ##ost ##r ##atus
Phil ##ost ##r ##atus II " the Athenian " ( c . 172 – 250 ) spoke of Nero in the Life of Apoll ##onius Ty ##ana ( Books 4 – 5 ) . Though he has a generally bad or dim view of Nero , he speaks of others ' positive reception of Nero in the East .
Pliny the Elder
The history of Nero by Pliny the Elder ( c . 24 – 79 ) did not survive . Still , there are several references to Nero in Pliny ' s Natural Hist ##ories . Pliny has one of the worst opinions of Nero and calls him an " enemy of mankind . "
Plutarch
Plutarch ( c . 46 – 127 ) mentions Nero indirectly in his account of the Life of Gal ##ba and the Life of Oth ##o . Nero is portrayed as a tyrant , but those that replace him are not described as better .
Seneca the Younger
It is not surprising that Seneca ( c . 4 BC – 65 ) , Nero ' s teacher and advisor , writes very well of Nero .
Su ##eton ##ius
Su ##eton ##ius ( c . 69 – 130 ) was a member of the equestrian order , and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence . While in this position , Su ##eton ##ius started writing biographies of the emperors , accent ##uating the anecd ##otal and sensational aspects .
Tac ##itus
The Annals by Tac ##itus ( c . 56 – 117 ) is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of Nero , despite being incomplete after the year 66 . Tac ##itus described the rule of the Julio @ - @ Claud ##ian emperors as generally unjust . He also thought that existing writing on them was un ##balanced :
The histories of Tiberius , Cai ##us , Claudius and Nero , while they were in power , were fals ##ified through terror , and after their death were written under the irrit ##ation of a recent hatred .
Tac ##itus was the son of a proc ##ur ##ator , who married into the elite family of Ag ##ric ##ola . He entered his political life as a senator after Nero ' s death and , by Tac ##itus ' own admission , owed much to Nero ' s rivals . Real ##ising that this bias may be apparent to others , Tac ##itus protests that his writing is true .
Gi ##rol ##amo Card ##ano
In 156 ##2 Gi ##rol ##amo Card ##ano published in Basel his En ##com ##ium Ner ##onis , which was one of the first historical references of the Modern era to portray Nero in a positive light .

At the end of 66 , conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caes ##are ##a . According to the Tal ##mud , Nero went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions . All the arrows landed in the city . He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day . The child responded , " I will lay my vengeance upon Ed ##om by the hand of my people Israel " ( Ez . 25 @ , @ 14 ) . Nero became terrified , believing that God wanted the Temple in Jerusalem to be destroyed , but would punish the one to carry it out . Nero said , " He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me , " whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such retribution . Vespasian was then dispatched to put down the rebellion .
The Tal ##mud adds that the sage Reb Me ##ir Ba ##al Ha ##N ##ess , Rabbi Me ##ir or Rabbi Me ##ir Ba ##al Ha ##N ##es ( Rabbi Me ##ir the miracle maker ) was a Jewish sage who lived in the time of the M ##ishna a prominent supporter of the Bar Kok ##h ##ba rebellion against Roman rule . He was considered one of the greatest of the Tann ##aim of the third generation ( 139 @ - @ 163 ) . According to the Tal ##mud , his father was a descendant of the Roman Emperor Nero who had converted to Judaism . His wife Br ##ur ##iah is one of the few women cited in the Gem ##ara . He is the third most frequently mentioned sage in the M ##ishn ##ah .
Roman and Greek sources nowhere report Nero ' s alleged trip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism . There is also no record of Nero having any offspring who survived infancy : his only recorded child , Claudia Augusta , died aged 4 months .
= = = Christian tradition = = =
Non @ - @ Christian historian Tac ##itus describes Nero extensively tort ##uring and executing Christians after the fire of 64 . Su ##eton ##ius also mentions Nero pun ##ishing Christians , though he does so because they are " given to a new and mis ##chie ##vous superst ##ition " and does not connect it with the fire .
Christian writer T ##ert ##ull ##ian ( c . 155 – 230 ) was the first to call Nero the first pers ##ecut ##or of Christians . He wrote , " Ex ##amine your records . There you will find that Nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine " . Lact ##ant ##ius ( c . 240 – 320 ) also said that Nero " first persecuted the servants of God " . as does Sul ##p ##ic ##ius Sever ##us . However , Su ##eton ##ius writes that , " since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the inst ##igation of Chr ##est ##us , he [ emperor Claudius ] expelled them from Rome " ( " I ##ud ##ae ##os impuls ##ore Chr ##esto ass ##id ##ue tumult ##u ##ant ##is Roma exp ##ul ##it " ) . These expelled " Jews " may have been early Christians , although Su ##eton ##ius is not explicit . Nor is the Bible explicit , calling Aqu ##ila of Pont ##us and his wife , Pr ##isc ##illa , both expelled from Italy at the time , " Jews " .
= = = = Martyr ##dom ##s of Peter and Paul = = = =
The first text to suggest that Nero ordered the execution of an apost ##le is a letter by Clement to the Corinth ##ians traditional dated to around 96 A . D . The apoc ##ry ##phal Ascension of Isaiah , a Christian writing from the 2nd century says , " the sl ##ayer of his mother , who himself ( even ) this king , will pers ##ecute the plant which the Twelve Apost ##les of the Bel ##oved have planted . Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands " was interpreted to mean Nero .
Bishop Eusebius of Caes ##are ##a ( c . 275 – 339 ) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign of Nero . He states that Nero ' s persecution led to Peter and Paul ' s deaths , but that Nero did not give any specific orders . However , several other accounts going back to the 1st century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to Hisp ##ania , before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death .
Peter is first said to have been cruc ##ified upside @ - @ down in Rome during Nero ' s reign ( but not by Nero ) in the apoc ##ry ##phal Acts of Peter ( c . 200 ) . The account ends with Paul still alive and Nero ab ##iding by God ' s command not to pers ##ecute any more Christians .
By the 4th century , a number of writers were stating that Nero killed Peter and Paul .
= = = = The Ant ##ich ##rist = = = =
The Sib ##yll ##ine Or ##acles , Book 5 and 8 , written in the 2nd century , speak of Nero returning and bringing destruction . Within Christian communities , these writings , along with others , fueled the belief that Nero would return as the Ant ##ich ##rist . In 310 , Lact ##ant ##ius wrote that Nero " suddenly disappeared , and even the burial place of that no ##x ##ious wild beast was nowhere to be seen . This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that , having been conveyed to a distant region , he is still reserved alive ; and to him they apply the Sib ##yll ##ine verses " , Lact ##ant ##ius maintains that it is not right to believe this .
In 422 , Augustine of Hipp ##o wrote about 2 Thessal ##on ##ians 2 : 1 – 11 , where he believed Paul mentioned the coming of the Ant ##ich ##rist . Though he rejects the theory , Augustine mentions that many Christians believed that Nero was the Ant ##ich ##rist or would return as the Ant ##ich ##rist . He wrote , " so that in saying , ' For the mystery of in ##iqu ##ity d ##oth already work , ' he alluded to Nero , whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Ant ##ich ##rist . "
Some modern biblical scholars such as Del ##bert Hill ##ers ( Johns Hopkins University ) of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the Oxford & Harper Collins Study B ##ibles , contend that the number 666 in the Book of Revelation is a code for Nero , a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries .
The concept of Nero as the Ant ##ich ##rist is often a central belief of Pre ##ter ##ist e ##sch ##at ##ology .
= Manila =
Manila ( / m ##əˈ ##n ##ɪ ##l . ə / ) is the capital city of the Philippines , founded on June 24 , 157 ##1 by Spanish conqu ##ist ##ador Miguel López de Leg ##az ##p ##i . It is one of the oldest cities in the country and was the seat of power for most of the colonial rules of the Philippines . It is situated on the eastern shore of Manila Bay and contains a multitude of landmarks , some of which date back to the 16th century , such as the Spanish colonial era W ##alled City of Intr ##amu ##ros .
Manila is the second most populous city in the Philippines after the former capital Que ##zon City with a population of 1 @ , @ 780 @ , @ 148 in 2015 . Because of its small land area and huge population , Manila is regarded as one of the most densely populated cities in the world with 42 @ , @ 85 ##7 people per square kilometer . Manila is one of the sixteen cities and a municipality that make up Metro Manila , the National Capital Region of the Philippines . In 2012 , Global ##ization and World Cities Research Network listed Manila as a global city .
Manila has six representative districts for the lower house of the Philippine Congress . Furthermore , the city is composed of 16 districts , namely : Bin ##ondo , Er ##m ##ita , Intr ##amu ##ros , Mal ##ate , Pac ##o , Pand ##ac ##an , Port Area , Qu ##i ##apo , Samp ##al ##oc , San And ##res , San Miguel , San Nicolas , Santa Ana , Santa Cruz , Santa Mesa and T ##ondo .
The Kingdom of T ##ondo once ruled in the vicinity of Manila before it briefly became a province of the Hindu Maj ##ap ##ah ##it Empire . During the Brunei invasion of the Philippines , Sultan B ##olk ##iah of Brunei captured Sel ##ud ##ong ( a village in modern @ - @ day Manila ) and renamed it May ##n ##il ##à , a Tag ##alog term referring to the presence of the N ##ila shrub . May ##n ##ila was a vassal state of Brunei , established to over ##power T ##ondo . May ##n ##il ##à had been Indian ##ized since the sixth century CE and earlier . It had become partly Islamic and Hindu @ - @ anim ##ist by the 15th century CE .
In 157 ##1 Spanish Con ##quist ##adors arrived from Mexico , from across the Pacific , and founded present @ - @ day Manila in what today is Intr ##amu ##ros . Spanish missionaries soon Christian ##ized the city and incorporated T ##ondo under Manila and then built some of the oldest churches in the country , including San Agust ##in Church . The Con ##quist ##adors renamed the area Nuevo Re ##ino de Cast ##illa ( New Kingdom of Cast ##ille ) and shortened the name to Manila .
Manila became the center of Spanish activity in the Far East and one end of the Manila @ - @ Acapulco Gal ##le ##on trade route , linking Spanish America with Asia , one of the earliest examples of globalization . Due to the central location in the Pacific sea trade routes , Manila received the moniker of the " Pearl of the Orient " . Spanish rule of Manila and the entire Philippine archipelago lasted for over three centuries , until 1898 . At different times during the long Spanish period there were local revolts , Chinese ins ##ur ##rect ##ions , massive pirate attacks , great earthquakes , Dutch raids and invasion attempts , and a British occupation of the city during their unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines . Order was usually quickly restored and the city returned to the business of trade . In the 19th century Manila was one of the most modern cities in Asia . Before the Spanish – American War , Manila saw the rise of the Philippine Revolution . Under the American rule following the Spanish – American War , the United States changed the official language from Spanish to English and made some changes in education , local laws and urban planning . Towards the end of World War II , during the Battle of Manila most of the city was flattened by intensive aerial bombardment by the United States Air Force . As a result , relatively little remains of Manila ' s pre ##war and colonial architecture , although there are ongoing restoration projects , especially within the old walled city , Intr ##amu ##ros .
= = History = =
The earliest evidence of human life in and around the area of Manila is the nearby Ang ##ono Pet ##rog ##lyph ##s dated to around 3000 BC . Furthermore , neg ##rit ##os , a class of Austral ##oid peoples , became the aboriginal inhabitants of the Philippines . They were found across Luzon before the Malay ##o @ - @ Polynes ##ians migrated in and assimilated them .
The Kingdom of T ##ondo flourished during the latter half of the Ming Dynasty as a result of direct trade relations with China . T ##ondo district was maintained as the traditional capital of the empire , with its rulers as sovereign kings and not mere chieft ##ains , and were addressed variously as p ##ang ##in ##uan l ##n Mer ##an ##au or p ##ang ##ino ##ón in Tag ##alog ( " lords " ) ; an ##ák ban ##wa ( " son of heaven " ) ; or l ##ak ##and ##ula ( " lord of the palace " ) , the Emperor of China considered the Lak ##ans ( rulers of ancient Manila ) " 王 " ( Kings ) .
In the 13th century , Manila consisted of a fortified settlement and trading quarter at the shores of the Pas ##ig River , on top of previous older towns . Manila was then settled by the Indian ##ized empire of Maj ##ap ##ah ##it as referenced in the epic eulogy poem Nagar ##ak ##ret ##ag ##ama which inscribed its conquest by Mahar ##aja Hay ##am Wur ##uk . Sel ##ur ##ong " ष ##े ##ल ##ु ##र ##ो ##न ् ग ् " which is a historical name for the city of Manila is listed in C ##anto 14 alongside Sul ##ot , which is now S ##ulu , and K ##alk ##a .
During the reign of Sultan B ##olk ##iah from 148 ##5 to 152 ##1 , the Brune ##ian Empire invaded , wanting to take advantage of T ##ondo ' s China trade by attacking its en ##vir ##ons and establishing " ك ##و ##ت ##ا س ##ل ##و ##د ##و ##ڠ Kota Sal ##ud ##ong " ( The Kingdom of May ##n ##ila ) . They ruled under and gave yearly tribute to the Sultanate of Brunei as its satellite state . They established a new dynasty under the local leader who accepted Islam and became Raj ##ah Sal ##al ##ila or T ##ari ##q Sul ##ay ##man I . He also established a trading challenge to the already rich House of Lak ##an D ##ula in T ##ondo . Islam was further strengthened by the arrival of Muslim traders from the Arab @ - @ Indian area and Southeast Asia . Manila was temporarily besieged by the invasion of Chinese pirate @ - @ war ##lord Lim ##ah ##ong ( 157 ##4 ) but was thwarted by the local inhabitants , before it became the seat of the colonial government of Spain .
On June 24 , 157 ##1 , Spanish conqu ##ist ##ador Miguel López de Leg ##az ##p ##i arrived from New Spain ( now Mexico ) , and then exercised rule of the Spanish city of Manila as a territory of New Spain with the establishment of a city council in what today is the district of Intr ##amu ##ros . López de Leg ##az ##p ##i had the local royalty executed or exiled , after the failure of the T ##ondo Conspiracy ; a plot wherein an alliance between Japanese merchants , Luzon ' s Hu ##angs with several D ##atus and Raj ##ah ##s plus the Brune ##ian Empire would band together to execute the Spaniards and their Latin @ - @ American mercenaries , and Vis ##ayan allies . At the conclusion of which , the victorious Spaniards made Manila the capital of the Spanish East Indies and of the Philippines , which the empire would control for the next three centuries , from 156 ##5 to 1898 .
Manila then became famous during the Manila @ - @ Acapulco Gal ##le ##on trade which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe , Africa and Latin America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia ( Which was already an ent ##rep ##ot for goods coming from India , Indonesia and China ) and trade also flowed vice versa . Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru were exchanged for Chinese silk , Indian gems , and the spices of the Southeast Asia , some of which even flowed to Europe . Likewise wines and ol ##ives grown from Europe and North Africa were trans ##sh ##ipped via Mexico towards Manila .
Manila was occupied by British forces for twenty months , from 1762 to 1764 , and used as a base for an unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines during the Seven Years ' War . Eventually , the British withdrew from Manila as per agreements in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . The Chinese were punished for supporting the British invasion , and the small fortress @ - @ city of Intr ##amu ##ros , mostly populated by Europeans and Mex ##icans , kept its cannons pointed at Bin ##ondo , the world ' s oldest Chinatown .
Mexican Independence in 1821 necessitated direct rule from Spain . Under direct Spanish rule , banking , industry and education flourished more than it had in the previous two centuries . The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain .
The growing wealth and education attracted indigenous , Chinese , Indians , Latin ##os , and Europeans from the provinces to Manila , all of whom elected a nascent Filipino citizenship regardless of ethnicity . The developments also facilitated the rise of an illust ##r ##ado class which espoused liberal ideas , the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution which sought independence from Spain .
After the Battle of Manila ( 1898 ) , Spain ceded the surrendered city of Manila to the United States . The First Philippine Republic based at nearby Bul ##ac ##an fought against the Americans for control of the city of Manila . The Americans defeated the First Philippine Republic and captured president Emilio Agu ##inal ##do who announced allegiance to the United States on April 1 , 1901 .
Upon drafting a new charter for Manila in June 1901 , the Americans made official what had long been tac ##it : that the City of Manila was not Intr ##amu ##ros alone but also all its arr ##ab ##ales . The new city charter proclaimed that Manila was composed of eleven municipal districts — presumably T ##ondo , Bin ##ondo , Santa Cruz , Samp ##al ##oc , San Miguel , Pand ##ac ##an , Santa Ana , Pac ##o , Mal ##ate , Er ##m ##ita and Intr ##amu ##ros . In addition to these , the Church recognized five parishes as Man ##il ##eno — namely , G ##ag ##al ##ang ##in , Tro ##zo , Bal ##ic @ - @ Bal ##ic , Santa Mesa and Sing ##al ##ong . Later times would add two more : Bal ##ut and San And ##res Buk ##id .
Under American control , a new civilian oriented Ins ##ular Government headed by then Governor @ - @ General William Howard Taft invited city pl ##anner Daniel Burnham for the transformation of Manila , to adapt the old city to changed times and modern needs . The Burnham Plan included development of the road system , the use of waterways for transportation , and beaut ##ification of Manila with the improvement of water ##f ##ron ##ts , construction of parks , park ##ways and various building for various activities .
The latter included a government center occupying all of Wallace Field , which extends from Lun ##eta to the present Taft Avenue . The Philippine Capitol was to rise at the Taft Avenue end of the field , facing toward the sea , and would form , with the buildings of different government b ##ure ##aus and departments , a quadrangle , lagoon in the center , and a monument to José R ##izal at its Lun ##eta end . Of Burnham ' s proposed government center , only three units — the Legislative Building and the building of the Finance and Agricultural departments — were completed when World War II erupted .
Due to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines , American soldiers were ordered to withdraw from the city and all military installations were removed on December 24 , 1941 . General Douglas MacArthur declared Manila an open city to prevent further death and destruction ; despite this , the Japanese war ##planes continued to bomb the city . Manila was occupied by the Japanese forces on January 2 , 1942 .
Manila was also the site of the blood ##iest battle in the Pacific theater during the Second World War . After falling to the Empire of Japan on January 2 , 1942 , it was recaptured by joint American and Filipino troops from February 3 to March 3 , 1945 . Some 100 @ , @ 000 civilians were killed in Manila in February 1945 . It was the second most devastated city in the world after Warsaw during the Second World War . At the end of World War II , almost all of the structures in the city , particularly Intr ##amu ##ros , were destroyed but after the war , reconstruction took place .
In 1948 , President El ##pid ##io Quir ##ino moved the seat of government of the Philippines to Que ##zon City , a new capital city in the suburbs and fields northeast of Manila , created in 1938 by former President Manuel L . Que ##zon , which was named after him . The move ended any implementation of the Burnham Plan ' s intent for the government centre to be at Lun ##eta .
With the Vis ##ayan @ - @ born Ar ##sen ##io Lac ##son as its first elected mayor in 1952 ( all may ##ors were appointed prior to this ) , Manila underwent The Golden Age , once again earning its status as the " Pearl of the Orient " , a moniker it earned before the Second World War . After Lac ##son ' s term in the 1950s , Manila was led by Antonio Ville ##gas for most of the 1960s . Ramon Bag ##ats ##ing ( an Indian @ - @ Filipino ) was mayor for nearly the entire 1970s until the 1986 People Power Revolution . May ##ors Lac ##son , Ville ##gas , and Bag ##ats ##ing are often collectively considered as the " Big Three of Manila " less for their rather long ten ##ures as the city ' s chief executive ( continuously for over three decades , from 1952 – 1986 ) , but more for their ind ##el ##ible contribution to the development and progress of the city and their lasting legacy in uplifting the quality of life and welfare of the people of Manila .
During the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos , the region of the Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Dec ##ree No . 82 ##4 on November 7 , 1975 . The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns , as a separate regional unit of government . On the 405 ##th anniversary of the city ' s foundation on June 24 , 1976 , Manila was reinstated by Marcos as the capital of the Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period . Presidential Dec ##ree No . 940 states that Manila has always been to the Filipino people and in the eyes of the world , the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade , commerce , education and culture .
During the martial law era , Manila became a hot @ - @ bed of resistance activity as youth and student demonstrators repeatedly clashed with the police and military which were subs ##erv ##ient to the Marcos regime . After decades of resistance , the non @ - @ violent People Power Revolution ( predecessor to the peaceful @ - @ revolutions that toppled the iron @ - @ curtain in Europe ) , ousted the authoritarian Marcos from power .
In 1992 , Alfred ##o Lim was elected mayor , the first Chinese @ - @ Filipino to hold the office . He was known for his anti @ - @ crime crus ##ades . Lim was succeeded by L ##ito At ##ien ##za , who served as his vice @ - @ mayor . At ##ien ##za was known for his campaign ( and city slogan ) " Bu ##hay ##in ang May ##n ##ila " ( Rev ##ive Manila ) , which saw the establishment of several parks and the repair and rehabilitation of the city ' s deteriorating facilities . He was the city ' s mayor for 3 terms ( 9 years ) before being termed out of office .
Alfred ##o Lim once again ran for mayor and defeated At ##ien ##za ' s son Ali in the 2007 city election and immediately reversed all of At ##ien ##za ' s projects claiming At ##ien ##za ' s projects made little contribution to the improvements of the city . The relationship of both parties turned bitter , with the two pitting again during the 2010 city elections in which Lim won against At ##ien ##za .
Lim was sued by council ##or Dennis Al ##core ##za on 2008 over human rights , charged with graft over the rehabilitation of public schools , and was heavily criticized for his h ##aph ##azard resolution of the R ##izal Park hostage taking incident , one of the deadliest hostage crisis in the Philippines . Later on , Vice Mayor Is ##ko Moreno and 28 city council ##ors filed another case against Lim in 2012 , stating that Lim ' s statement in a meeting were " life @ - @ threatening " to them . On the 2013 elections , former President Joseph Estr ##ada defeated Lim in the mayoral race . During his term , Estr ##ada has paid the city ' s over ₱ 5 billion debts , increase revenues by 2 @ . @ 35 times from ₱ 6 @ . @ 2 billion in 2012 to ₱ 14 @ . @ 6 billion by 2016 , spent from 2013 to 2016 an unprecedented ₱ 6 @ . @ 76 billion for the city ' s infrastructure , built and or renovated seven city public markets , built 22 schools , increased teachers ' inc ##omes , modernized the six city hospitals and bought dial ##ysis machines and magnetic resonance imaging sc ##anners , increased the efficiency of the police force and reduced crime . Manila has become the most competitive city in the Philippines by 2015 , making the city the best place for doing business and for living in .
Despite his achievements and unprecedented feat as the Mayor of Manila , however , Estr ##ada was re @ - @ elected as Manila mayor in the 2016 election against Lim and Am ##ado Bag ##ats ##ing , only winning by an inf ##in ##ites ##imal 2 @ , @ 830 votes .

Manila is located on the eastern shores of Manila bay , which rests on the western shores of Luzon . Manila lies 800 miles ( 1 @ , @ 300 kilometers ) from mainland Asia . The Pas ##ig River bis ##ects Manila .
Almost all of Manila sits on top of centuries of prehistoric alluvial deposits built by the waters of the Pas ##ig and on some land reclaimed from Manila Bay . Manila ' s land has been altered substantially by human intervention , with considerable land rec ##lamation along the water ##f ##ron ##ts since the American colonial times . Some of the natural variations in topography have been even ##ed out due to the urban ##ization of the city . As of 2013 , Manila has a total area of 42 @ . @ 88 square kilometres ( 16 @ . @ 56 sq mi ) .

Manila sits ast ##ride the Pacific typhoon belt and is cr ##iss @ - @ crossed by several fault lines . This led to Manila and its metropolitan region to be ranked as the second ris ##ki ##est capital ( city ) to live in according to Swiss Re . The seism ##ically active Mar ##ik ##ina Valley Fault System poses a threat to Manila and the surrounding regions .
Manila has endured several deadly earthquakes , notably in 1645 and in 167 ##7 which destroyed the stone and brick medieval city . The Earthqu ##ake Baroque style was used by the Colonial architects during the Spanish colonial period in order to adapt to the frequent earthquakes .
= = = Climate = = =
Under the Köppen climate classification system , Manila features a tropical sav ##anna climate ( Köppen climate classification Aw ) . Together with the rest of the Philippines , Manila lies entirely within the tropics . Its proximity to the equator means that the temperature range is very small , rarely going below 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) or above 38 ° C ( 100 ° F ) . Temper ##ature extremes have ranged from 14 @ . @ 5 ° C ( 58 @ . @ 1 ° F ) on January 11 , 1914 to 38 @ . @ 6 ° C ( 101 @ . @ 5 ° F ) on May 7 , 1915 .
Hum ##idity levels are usually very high all year round . Manila has a distinct dry season from December through May , and a relatively lengthy wet season that covers the remaining period with slightly cooler temperatures . In the rainy season it rarely rains all day but the rainfall is very heavy during short periods . T ##yph ##oons usually occur from June to September .

Due to industrial waste and automobiles , Manila suffers from air pollution , affecting 98 % of the population . Ann ##ually , the air pollution causes more than 4 @ , @ 000 deaths . Er ##m ##ita is Manila ' s most air polluted district due to open dump sites and industrial waste . According to a report in 2003 , The Pas ##ig River is one of the most polluted rivers in the world with 150 tons of domestic waste and 75 tons of industrial waste dumped daily .
Ann ##ually , Manila is hit with 6 to 7 typh ##oons creating floods . In 2009 , Typhoon K ##ets ##ana struck Philippines . In the aftermath of Typhoon K ##ets ##ana , the lack of infrastructure led to one of the worst flood ##ings in the Philippines and creating a significant amount of pollution . Following the aftermath of Typhoon K ##ets ##ana , the city began to dred ##ge its rivers and improve its drainage network . The Pas ##ig River Reh ##abil ##itation Commission is in charge of cleaning up the Pas ##ig River and tributaries for transportation , recreation and tourism purposes . Reh ##abil ##itation efforts have resulted in the creation of parks along the rivers ##ide , along with st ##ric ##ter pollution controls .

Manila has architect ##urally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods . Architectural styles reflect American , Spanish , Chinese , and Malay influences . Promin ##et Filipino architects such as Antonio Toledo , Felipe Rox ##as , Juan M . Are ##ll ##ano and Tom ##ás Map ##úa have designed significant buildings in Manila such as churches , government offices , theaters , mans ##ions , schools and universities .
Manila is known for its distinct Art Dec ##o theaters which are designed by National Artists such as Juan Nak ##p ##il and Pablo Antonio . The historic Esc ##olta Street in Bin ##ondo features many buildings of neo @ - @ classical and be ##aux @ - @ arts architectural style , many of which were designed by prominent Filipino architects during the American Rule in the 1920s to the late 1930s . Many architects , artists , historians and heritage advocacy groups are pushing for the revival of Esc ##olta Street , which was once the premier street of the Philippines .
Unfortunately , much of Manila ' s pre ##war and Spanish colonial architecture was destroyed during World War II . Reconstruction took place afterwards , replacing the destroyed historic Spanish @ - @ era buildings with modern ones , er ##asing much of the city ' s character . Some buildings destroyed by the war have been reconstructed , such as the Old Legislative Building ( National Museum ) , Ay ##unt ##am ##iento de Manila ( Bureau of the Treasury ) and the currently under construction San Ignacio Church ( Mus ##eo de Intr ##amu ##ros ) . Plans have been laid out to rehabil ##itate several neglected historic buildings and places such as Plaza Del Carmen , San Sebastian Church and the Manila Metropolitan Theater and soon Spanish @ - @ era shops and houses in Qu ##i ##apo , Bin ##ondo , and San Nicolas will be restored to its former splend ##or , as a part of a movement to restore Manila to its former glory .
Since Manila is prone to earthquakes , the Spanish colonial architects invented the style called Earthqu ##ake Baroque which the churches and government buildings during the Spanish colonial period adopted . As a result , succeeding earthquakes of the 18th and 19th centuries barely affected Manila , although it did periodically level the surrounding area . Modern buildings in and around Manila are designed or have retro ##f ##itted to withstand an 8 @ . @ 2 magnitude quake in accordance to the country ' s building code .

Previously a widely played sport in the city , Manila is now the home of the only sizable baseball stadium in the country , at the R ##izal Memorial Baseball Stadium . The stadium hosts games of Baseball Philippines ; Lou Ge ##hr ##ig and Babe Ruth were the first players to score a home run at the stadium at their tour of the country on December 2 , 1934 .
Another popular sport in the city are cue sports , and bill ##iard halls are a feature in most bar ##ang ##ays . The 2010 World Cup of Pool was held at Rob ##ins ##ons Place Manila .
The R ##izal Memorial Track and Football Stadium hosted the first FIFA World Cup qualifier in decades when the Philippines hosted Sri Lanka in July 2011 . The stadium , which was previously unfit for international matches , had undergone a major renovation program prior to the match . The Football Stadium now regularly hosts matches of the United Football League . The stadium also hosted its first rugby test when it hosted the 2012 Asian Five Nations Division I tournaments .
= = Government and politics = =
The government of Manila is divided into three branches : executive , legislative and judiciary . The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines under the Metro Manila judicial region . The city government have control of the executive and legislative branch . Manila employs 11 @ , @ 91 ##9 personnel at the end of 2014 .
The current Mayor of Manila is Joseph Estr ##ada , who served as the President of the Philippines from 1998 @ - @ 2001 . He is also the head of the executive department of the city . The legislative arm which is composed of six elected city council ##ors , is headed by the Vice Mayor . Former actor Is ##ko Moreno currently serves as the city ' s vice mayor .

Manila has six legislative districts that serve as the constituencies for the election of the city ' s representatives to the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines and of the regular members to the Sang ##gun ##iang Pan ##l ##ungs ##od ( SP ; City Council ) . Each district elects one representative to the House of Representatives and six SP members to the council . The city , along with the rest of the nation , elects 12 senators as one at @ - @ large district .
Manila is politically divided into 896 bar ##ang ##ays , the smallest unit of local government in the Philippines . Each bar ##ang ##ay has its own chair ##person and council ##ors . For administrative convenience , all the bar ##ang ##ays in Manila are grouped into 100 zones . These zones have no form of local government .
The 1st District ( 2015 population : 415 @ , @ 90 ##6 ) is Manila ' s ( and the country ' s ) most densely populated congressional district . It covers the western portion of T ##ondo that lies along Manila Bay .
The 2nd District ( 2015 population : 215 @ , @ 457 ) covers the eastern inland portion of T ##ondo , a neighborhood or sub @ - @ district known as G ##ag ##al ##ang ##in .
The 3rd District ( 2015 population : 197 @ , @ 242 ) covers Bin ##ondo , Qu ##i ##apo , San Nicolas and Santa Cruz .

Manila has the most number of bar ##ang ##ays of any city or municipality in the Philippines . Attempts at reducing its number have not prospered despite local legislation — Ordin ##ance 790 ##7 , passed on 23 April 1996 — reducing the number from 89 ##7 to 150 by merging existing bar ##ang ##ays , because of the failure to hold a ple ##b ##isc ##ite .
= = = National government = = =
Manila , being the seat of political power of the Philippines , has several national government offices headquartered at the city . Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of American colonization to the country when they envisioned a well @ - @ designed city outside the walls of Intr ##amu ##ros . The strategic location chosen was Bag ##umb ##ayan , a former town which is now the R ##izal Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to Daniel Burnham to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington D . C . . These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L . Que ##zon .
A new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila , or what is now Que ##zon City . Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Que ##zon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila . However , many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations .
The city , as the capital , still hosts the Office of the President , as well as the president ' s official residence . Aside from these , important institutions such as the Supreme Court , the Court of Appeals , the Bang ##ko Sent ##ral n ##g Pil ##ip ##inas , the Dep ##artments of Budget and Management , Finance , Health , Justice , Labor and Employ ##ment and Public Works and Highways still call the city home . Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library , National Archives , National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital .
Congress previously held office at the Old Congress Building . In 1972 , due to declaration of martial law , Congress was dissolved ; its successor , the un ##ic ##amer ##al Bat ##as ##ang P ##amb ##ans ##a , held office at the new Bat ##as ##ang P ##amb ##ans ##a Complex . When a new constitution restored the bic ##amer ##al Congress , the House of Representatives stayed at the Bat ##as ##ang P ##amb ##ans ##a Complex , while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building . In May 1997 , the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at Pas ##ay .

One of the more famous modes of transportation in Manila is the j ##eep ##ney . Pattern ##ed after U . S . army j ##eeps , these have been in use since the years immediately following World War II . The Tamar ##aw FX , the third generation Toyota K ##ij ##ang , which competed directly with j ##eep ##ney ##s and followed fixed routes for a set price , once pl ##ied the streets of Manila .
On a for @ - @ hire basis , the city is served by numerous tax ##ic ##abs , " tr ##icy ##cles " ( motorcycles with sid ##ec ##ars , the Philippine version of the auto r ##ick ##shaw ) , and " tr ##is ##ik ##ads " or " s ##ik ##ads " ( bicycles with a sid ##ec ##ars , the Philippine version of ped ##ic ##abs ) . In some areas , especially in Div ##is ##oria , motor ##ized ped ##ic ##abs are popular . Spanish @ - @ era horse @ - @ drawn c ##ales ##as are still a popular tourist attraction and mode of transportation in the streets of Bin ##ondo and Intr ##amu ##ros . All types of public road transport are privately owned and operated under government franchise .
The city is serviced by the L ##RT @ - @ 1 and L ##RT @ - @ 2 which forms the L ##R ##TA system , as distinct from the M ##RT @ - @ 3 which is under the MR ##TC system that services other parts of Metro Manila . Development of the railway system began in the 1970s under the Marcos administration , making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia . These systems are currently undergoing a mult ##ib ##illion @ - @ dollar expansion . L ##RT Line 1 runs along the length of Taft Avenue ( R @ - @ 2 ) and R ##izal Avenue ( R @ - @ 9 ) , and the L ##RT Line 2 runs along Cl ##aro M .

The main terminal of the Philippine National Railways lies within the city . One commuter railway within Metro Manila is in operation . The line runs in a general north @ - @ south direction from Tut ##uban ( T ##ondo ) toward Laguna . The Port of Manila , located in the vicinity of Manila Bay is the chief seap ##ort of the Philippines . The Pas ##ig River Ferry Service which runs on the Pas ##ig River is another form of transportation . The city is also served by the N ##in ##oy Aqu ##ino International Airport and Clark International Airport .
In 2006 , Forbes magazine ranked Manila " the world ' s most cong ##ested city " . Manila has become notorious for its frequent traffic jams and high densities . The government has undertaken several projects to alleviate the traffic in the city . Some of the projects include : the construction of a new fly ##over at Samp ##al ##oc , the construction of the Metro Manila Sky ##way Stage 3 , the proposed L ##RT Line 2 ( west ) extension from R ##ect ##o to T ##ondo or the Port Area , and the expansion of several national and local roads . However , such projects have yet to make any meaningful impact , and the traffic jams and congestion continue unab ##ated . The urban planning of the Manila and the whole met ##ropolis was based on the Metro Manila Dream Plan , which seeks to address the problems of Metro Manila ' s urban planning and transportation . It consists of a list of short term priority projects and medium to long term infrastructure projects that will last up to 20 ##30 .

The center of education since the colonial period , Manila — particularly Intr ##amu ##ros — is home to several Philippine universities and colleges as well as its oldest ones . It served as the home of the University of Santo Tomas ( 161 ##1 ) , Col ##eg ##io de San Juan de Let ##ran ( 1620 ) , At ##ene ##o de Manila University ( 1859 ) , Ly ##ce ##um of the Philippines University and the Map ##ua Institute of Technology . Only Col ##eg ##io de San Juan de Let ##ran ( 1620 ) remains at Intr ##amu ##ros ; the University of Santo Tomas transferred to a new campus at Samp ##al ##oc in 1927 , and At ##ene ##o left Intr ##amu ##ros for Loy ##ola Heights , Que ##zon City ( while still retaining " de Manila " in its name ) in 1952 .
The University of the City of Manila ( Pam ##antas ##an n ##g L ##ungs ##od n ##g May ##n ##ila ) located at Intr ##amu ##ros , and Univers ##idad de Manila located just outside the walled city , are both owned and operated by the Manila city government . The national government controls the University of the Philippines Manila , the oldest of the University of the Philippines constituent universities and the center of health sciences education in the country . The city is also the site of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines , the largest university in the country in terms of student population .
The University Belt refers to the area where there is a high concentration or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city and it is commonly understood as the one where the San Miguel , Qu ##i ##apo and Samp ##al ##oc districts meet .

= Att ##alea ( palm ) =
Att ##alea is a large genus of palms native to Mexico , the Caribbean , Central and South America . This pinn ##ately le ##aved , non @ - @ spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an ab ##ov ##eg ##round stem and large trees . The genus has a complicated taxonomic history , and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers . Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers , the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus . This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny .
Somew ##here between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus , with estimates of as many as 100 . In ##com ##pl ##ete her ##bar ##ium collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species , or groups of similar species . Att ##alea species have a long history of human use , and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre . Many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats . Their seeds are animal dispersed , including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now @ - @ extinct Pleistocene meg ##af ##auna .
= = Description = =
The genus Att ##alea has pinn ##ately compound leaves — rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather @ - @ like or f ##ern @ - @ like pattern . Species are also non @ - @ spiny palms and includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) tall and ac ##aul ##es ##cent palms ( one which lack an ab ##ov ##eg ##round stem ) . The number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty @ - @ five ; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves .
In ##fl ##ores ##cences are large , branched and borne among the leaves . The inflores ##cence consists of a main axis — the ped ##un ##cle and the r ##ach ##is — and a series of smaller branches , the r ##ach ##ill ##ae . The r ##ach ##ill ##ae , which bear the flowers , emerge from the r ##ach ##is . The ped ##un ##cle is the main stalk , connecting the r ##ach ##is with the stem . In ##fl ##ores ##cences either consist entirely of male flowers , or are predominantly female with a few male flowers . Fruit usually have two or three seeds , although fewer or more are present in some species , and are usually brown , yellow , orange @ - @ brown or purple when mature .
Four different types of male flowers exist . On the basis of these flower types , the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined Att ##alea , Orb ##ign ##ya , Maxim ##il ##iana and Sche ##el ##ea . The species sometimes referred to Orb ##ign ##ya have co ##iled an ##ther ##s , while the other groups have straight ones . The pet ##als of those placed in Maxim ##il ##iana are much shorter than the st ##am ##ens , while those placed in Sche ##el ##ea and a more narrowly defined Att ##alea have pet ##als that are longer than the st ##am ##ens . Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups ; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus .
= = Taxonomy = =
Att ##alea has been placed in the subfamily Are ##co ##ide ##ae , the tribe Coc ##ose ##ae and the subt ##ribe Att ##ale ##inae , together with the genera All ##ag ##optera , Bec ##c ##ari ##oph ##oen ##ix , But ##ia , Coc ##os , Juba ##ea , Jub ##ae ##opsis , Ly ##t ##oc ##ary ##um , Par ##aj ##uba ##ea , Sy ##ag ##rus and Vo ##an ##io ##ala . Within this subt ##ribe , Att ##alea has been found to be a monophyletic group , and sister to the clade containing All ##ag ##optera , Poly ##and ##roc ##oc ##os , Par ##aj ##uba ##ea , But ##ia and Juba ##ea .
Dis ##agre ##ement exists as to whether Att ##alea should be considered a single genus , or a group of related genera . In their 1996 Field Guide to the Pal ##ms of the Americas , Andrew Henderson , Gloria Gale ##ano and Rodrig ##o Bern ##al combined all the species in the subt ##ribe Att ##ale ##inae ( as it was then defined ) into a single genus , Att ##alea . In his 1999 Tax ##on ##omic Treatment of Palm Sub ##t ##ribe Att ##ale ##inae , American botanist Sidney F . Glass ##man divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined Att ##alea , Orb ##ign ##ya , Maxim ##il ##iana , Sche ##el ##ea and Y ##nes ##a . Raf ##ä ##el G ##ova ##erts and John Dr ##ans ##field recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Check ##list of Pal ##ms , and Jean @ - @ Christ ##ophe P ##int ##aud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus .
The multi @ - @ genus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers ; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another . Four of the genera — Att ##alea ( in a narrow sense ) , Orb ##ign ##ya , Maxim ##il ##iana and Sche ##el ##ea — correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus . However , a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types , including A . col ##end ##a ( which Glass ##man placed in its own genus , Y ##nes ##a ) and this has been used as an argument for the single @ - @ genus approach . In addition , there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under Glass ##man ' s five @ - @ genus system , which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus . In 2009 Alan Me ##er ##ow and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the subt ##ribe which found that some species placed in Orb ##ign ##ya were actually more closely related to species placed in Sche ##el ##ea than they were to other members of that genus ( if the five @ - @ genus approach was used ) , while A . cr ##ass ##isp ##atha , placed in Orb ##ign ##ya by Glass ##man , was actually a sister to both Sche ##el ##ea and Orb ##ign ##ya .
= = = History = = =
The genus Att ##alea was first described Carl Sigismund Kun ##th in 1816 based on specimens collected by Alexander von Humboldt and A ##im ##é Bon ##pl ##and , although older , pre @ - @ Lin ##na ##ean descriptions exist , including Charles Plum ##ier ' s 170 ##3 description of A . cr ##ass ##isp ##atha . The genus was named for Att ##alus III Phil ##omet ##or , king of Per ##g ##amon , known for his interest in medicinal plants . The type species is A . am ##yg ##dal ##ina , a Colombian endemic . The genera Maxim ##il ##iana and Orb ##ign ##ya were described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Mart ##ius in 1826 and 1837 respectively . Sche ##el ##ea was described by Hermann Kar ##sten in 1857 , and Y ##nes ##a by Or ##ator F . Cook in 1942 .
= = = Species = = =
Exper ##ts disagree about the number of species in the genus Att ##alea ( broadly defined ) . In 1965 , Dutch tax ##onom ##ist Jan Gerard Wess ##els Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus . In their 1996 Field Guide to the Pal ##ms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and co ##aut ##hors recognised 29 species in the genus , while Sidney Glass ##man recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group . Lar ##g ##ely following Glass ##man ' s lead , Raf ##a ##ël G ##ova ##erts and John Dr ##ans ##field recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Check ##list of Pal ##ms . An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glass ##man to define species more narrowly than Henderson . As a result , what Henderson interpreted as variation within species , Glass ##man took as differences between morph ##ologically similar species . This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in her ##bar ##ium collections . The large size of the leaves , inflorescences and fruit of many Att ##alea species makes them difficult to collect . In addition , many important collections , including type specimen , have been lost or destroyed . Sp ##arse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species .
The three recent treatments ( Henderson and co ##aut ##hors , Glass ##man , and G ##ova ##erts and Dr ##ans ##field ) recognised a total of 73 species , but only 20 species are accepted by all of them . The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40 . For example , what Andrew Henderson considered a single species , Att ##alea att ##ale ##oides , other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species . Glass ##man doubted the validity of A . att ##ale ##oides as a species , and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A . att ##ale ##oides — A . cam ##op ##iensis , A . degr ##an ##ville ##i , A . gu ##ian ##ensis and A . mar ##ip ##ensis . G ##ova ##erts and Dr ##ans ##field accepted both Glass ##man ' s four species and A . att ##ale ##oides . However , Jean @ - @ Christ ##ophe P ##int ##aud was of the opinion that A . gu ##ian ##ensis , A . mar ##ip ##ensis and A . att ##ale ##oides were all very similar , and thought it likely that they all represented the same species .
Another species complex in Att ##alea includes A . spec ##iosa and related species . Henderson ( 1995 ) recognised A . spec ##iosa and A . spect ##abil ##is , considering the latter to either be an ac ##aul ##es ##cent form of A . spec ##iosa or a hybrid between it and A . microc ##ar ##pa . G ##ova ##erts and Dr ##ans ##field accepted A . spect ##abil ##is , but Glass ##man considered it a dubious taxon . Att ##alea vit ##r ##iv ##ir was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Bal ##ick and co ##aut ##hors ; Glass ##man and G ##ova ##erts and Dr ##ans ##field concurred , but Henderson considered it part of A . spec ##iosa . Glass ##man also described a fourth member of this group , A . bre ##jin ##ho ##ensis , and it is accepted by G ##ova ##erts and Dr ##ans ##field .
= = Reproduction and growth = =
Att ##alea species are mono ##ec ##ious — male and female flowers are separate , but are borne by the same plant . Various species have been described as being insect @ - @ poll ##inated , including A . ph ##al ##er ##ata , while pollination in A . col ##end ##a and A . spec ##iosa , has been attributed both to insects and wind .
Seed germ ##ination is remote tubular — during germ ##ination , as the c ##oty ##ledon expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed . After germ ##ination , the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the ab ##ov ##eg ##round stem . This produces a " saxophone shaped " below ##ground portion of the stem . The fact that the shoot tips of Att ##alea seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire @ - @ tolerance .
= = Distribution = =
Species range across the Ne ##otrop ##ics from Mexico in the north to Bolivia , Paraguay , and southern Brazil in the south . According to G ##ova ##erts and co ##aut ##hors , three species are found in Mexico , four in Central America , and 62 in South America . Three species are present in the Caribbean — two in Trinidad and Tobago , along the southern edge of the region , and one in Haiti .
= = Habitat and ecology = =
Att ##alea includes both large trees and small ac ##aul ##es ##cent palms which occupy a number of different ecological niches . D ##ense stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape , while smaller species are found in both in the forest underst ##ore ##y and in sav ##ann ##as .
Disturb ##ance has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by large Att ##alea species . In seasonally dry Amaz ##onian forests the density of large adult A . mar ##ip ##a palms was correlated with canopy open ##ness ; the species also dominates sav ##ann ##as formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago . Att ##alea spec ##iosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared . Similarly , stands of A . fun ##ifera in Bah ##ia , Brazil ( which are cultivated for pi ##ass ##ava fibre ) are managed using fire — the seedlings survive cutting and burning , and are able to dominate burned forest patches .
The fruit are dispersed by animals ; fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by bru ##ch ##id beetles . Certain species of Att ##alea have been mentioned as examples of " an ##achron ##istic " species which are adapted for dispersal by now @ - @ extinct Pleistocene meg ##af ##auna . On Mar ##ac ##á Island , R ##or ##aim ##a , in the Brazilian Amazon , Att ##alea mar ##ip ##a fruit were consumed by tap ##irs , coll ##ared pec ##c ##aries , deer and primates . Rod ##ents , including ag ##out ##is , fed upon the fruit and , as the fruit availability declined , they fed on the seeds . Other dispers ##ers of Att ##alea fruit include Cr ##ested Car ##ac ##aras which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A . ph ##al ##er ##ata in the Brazilian Pant ##an ##al .
= = Uses = =
Att ##alea species have a long history of human util ##isation . Carbon ##ised Att ##alea mar ##ip ##a seeds have been found in archaeological sites in Colombia dating back to 900 ##0 BP . A variety of species remain important sources of edible oil , that ##ch , edible seeds and fibre . The leaves of Att ##alea but ##yr ##acea and A . mar ##ip ##a are used extensively for that ##ching . Several species are oil palms , with A . spec ##iosa among the most important economically . Products extracted from A . spec ##iosa were reported to support over 300 @ , @ 000 households in the Brazilian state of Mar ##an ##h ##ão in 2005 , and in 1985 it was estimated to support over 450 @ , @ 000 households throughout the Brazil . Pi ##ass ##ava fib ##res , extracted from the leaf bases of A . fun ##ifera , are commercially important , and generated about US $ 20 million in annual income to Brazilian farmers in 1996 .

The film was the final production and release of the Thanhouser Company and it was to be released through Path ##é . Numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser . Q . David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser ' s decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through Path ##é were based on their decision to release or disc ##ard the work , the New Roc ##hel ##le studio was 2 @ , @ 500 miles from the center of the trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I . Weeks before the film was released , Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio ' s staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the book ##keeper , Jessie B . Bishop . The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F . L ##oner ##gan , the scenario writer of the company , had retired from the company . As it wound down , the Thanhouser Company was announced to have no li ##abilities would close with a positive bank balance . Little is known of the production of this final film , but it was directed by Emile Ch ##aut ##ard from a scenario written by Lloyd F . L ##oner ##gan . The cameraman was Jacques B ##ize ##ul .

The five reel film was released through the Path ##é Exchange as a Path ##é Gold Ro ##oster Play on October 7 , 1917 . Charles E . Wagner of the Ex ##hib ##itor ' s Trade Review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography , but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real . Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and path ##os without sexual suggest ##iveness ; which should prove a strong program for the Path ##é program . Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences , but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer . A reviewer for the The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film ' s excessive use of coincident ##al meetings to be highly improb ##able , but found Ward ##e ' s performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances . The reviewer said that Emile Ch ##aut ##ard had made the improb ##able story more plausible .
Like many American films of the time , The Heart of Ezra Greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards . The Chicago Board of Cens ##ors required the cutting in Reel 2 of a letter stating , " I cannot face my father , " etc . , and two close ##ups of gambling scenes ; and in Reel 5 a change of the intert ##it ##le " Because it means her whole future " to " Because she is his wife " .
= Free Derry =
Free Derry ( Irish : Sa ##or D ##ho ##ire ) was a self @ - @ declared autonomous nationalist area of Derry , Northern Ireland , that existed between 1969 and 1972 . Its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the Bog ##side in January 1969 which read , " You are now entering Free Derry " . The area , which included the Bog ##side and C ##reg ##gan neighbourhood ##s , was secured by community activists for the first time on 5 January 1969 following an incurs ##ion into the Bog ##side by members of the Royal Ulster Const ##abulary ( R ##UC ) . Residents built barric ##ades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the R ##UC from entering . After six days the residents took down the barric ##ades and R ##UC patrols resumed , but tensions remained high over the following months .
Violence reached a peak on 12 August 1969 , culminating in the Battle of the Bog ##side — a three @ - @ day pitched battle between residents and the R ##UC . On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of the Bog ##side and the R ##UC were withdrawn . The Derry Citizens Defence Association ( DC ##DA ) declared their intention to hold the area against both the R ##UC and the British Army until their demands were met . The British Army made no attempt to enter the area . The situation continued until October 1969 when , following publication of the Hunt Report , military police were allowed in .
The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) began to re @ - @ arm and recruit after August 1969 . In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Both were supported by the people of the Free Derry area . Meanwhile , relations between the British Army and the nationalist community , which were initially good , deteriorated . In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops . The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971 , and in response , barric ##ades went up once more in the Bog ##side and C ##reg ##gan . This time , Free Derry was a no @ - @ go area , defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA . From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army , and the Provision ##als began a bombing campaign in the city centre . As before , unarmed ' a ##uxili ##aries ' manned the barric ##ades , and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police .
Support for the IRA increased further after Bloody Sunday in January 1972 , when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the British Army ' s Parachute Regiment at a march in the Bog ##side ( a 14th man was wounded and died 4 1⁄2 months later ) . The support began to w ##ane after the killing by the Official IRA of a local youth who was home on leave from the British Army . After a Provisional IRA ceasefire , during which it entered talks with the British government , broke down , the British took the decision to move against the " no @ - @ go " areas . Free Derry came to an end on 31 July 1972 , when thousands of British troops moved in with armoured cars and bulld ##oz ##ers to occupy the area .
= = Background = =
Derry City lies near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . It has a majority nationalist population , and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections . Despite this , the Ulster Union ##ist Party controlled the local council , L ##ond ##onder ##ry Corporation , from 1923 onwards . The Union ##ists maintained their majority , firstly , by manipulating the constituency boundaries ( g ##erry ##m ##andering ) so that the South Ward , with a nationalist majority , returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward and Waters ##ide Ward , with union ##ist major ##ities , returned twelve councillors between them ; second ##ly , by allowing only rate ##p ##ayers to vote in local elections , rather than one man , one vote , so that a higher number of nationalists , who did not own homes , were dis ##en ##franch ##ised ; and third ##ly , by denying houses to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency . The result was that there were about 2 @ , @ 000 nationalist families , and practically no union ##ists , on the housing waiting list , and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition . The South Ward comprised the Bog ##side , Brandy ##well , C ##reg ##gan , Bishop Street and F ##oyle Road , and it was this area that would become Free Derry .
The Derry Housing Action Committee ( DH ##AC ) was formed in March 1968 by members of the Derry Branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the James Conn ##olly Republican Club , including E ##am ##onn McCann and E ##amon Mel ##augh . It disrupted a meeting of L ##ond ##onder ##ry Corporation in March 1968 and in May blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of the Lec ##ky Road in the Bog ##side and staging a sit @ - @ down protest at the opening of the second deck of the Craig ##av ##on Bridge . After the meeting of L ##ond ##onder ##ry Corporation was again disrupted in August , E ##amon Mel ##augh teleph ##oned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( N ##IC ##RA ) and invited them to hold a march in Derry . The date chosen was 5 October 1968 , an ad ##h ##oc committee was formed ( although in reality most of the organizing was done by McCann and Mel ##augh ) and the route was to take the mar ##chers inside the city walls , where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march . The Minister of Home Affairs , William Craig , made an order on 3 October prohibiting the march on the grounds that the App ##rent ##ice Boys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day . In the words of Martin Mel ##augh of CA ##IN " this particular tactic . . . provided the excuse needed to ban the march . " When the mar ##chers attempted to def ##y the ban on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Const ##abulary ( R ##UC ) cord ##on . The police drew their bat ##ons and struck mar ##chers , including Storm ##ont MP Eddie McA ##te ##er and Westminster MP Gerry F ##itt . Subsequently the police " broke ranks and used their bat ##ons indisc ##rimin ##ately on people in Duke Street " . Mar ##chers trying to escape met another party of police and " these police also used their bat ##ons indisc ##rimin ##ately . " Water cannons were also used . The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry , and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens ' Action Committee ( DC ##AC ) was formed , with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vice @ - @ chairman .
= = The first barric ##ades = =
Another group formed as a result of the events of 5 October was People ' s Democracy , a group of students in Queen ' s University Belfast . They organised a march from Belfast to Derry in support of civil rights , starting out with about forty young people on 1 January 1969 . The march met with violent opposition from loyalist counter @ - @ demonstrators at several points along the route . Finally , at Bur ##nt ##oll ##et Bridge , five miles outside Derry , they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs — some of them stud ##ded with nails — and stones . Half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the B @ - @ Special ##s . The police , who were at the scene , ch ##atted to the B @ - @ Special ##s as they prepared their ambush , and then failed to protect the mar ##chers , many of whom ran into the river and were pel ##ted with stones from the bank . Do ##zens of mar ##chers were taken to hospital . The remainder continued on to Derry where they were attacked once more on their way to Craig ##av ##on Bridge before they finally reached Guild ##hall Square , where they held a rally . Riot ##ing broke out after the rally . Police drove rioters into the Bog ##side , but did not come after them . In the early hours of the following morning , 5 January , members of the R ##UC charged into St . Columb ' s Wells and Lec ##ky Road in the Bog ##side , breaking windows and beating residents . In his report on the disturbances , Lord Cameron remarked that " for such conduct among members of a disciplined and well @ - @ led force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse " and added that " its effect in r ##ousing passions and inspiring hostility towards the police was reg ##rett ##ably great . "
That afternoon over 1 @ , @ 500 Bog ##side residents built barric ##ades , armed themselves with steel bars , wooden clubs and hur ##leys , and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area . DC ##AC chairman John Hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and no @ - @ one was to come in . Groups of men wearing arm ##bands patrolled the streets in shifts . John ' C ##aker ' Casey , a local activist , painted " You are now entering Free Derry " in white paint on the gable wall of a house on the corner of Lec ##ky Road and F ##ahan Street . That corner , which was a popular venue for meetings , later became known as " Free Derry Corner " . On 7 January , the barric ##aded area was extended to include the C ##reg ##gan , another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the Bog ##side . A clandest ##ine radio station calling itself " Radio Free Derry " began broadcasting to residents , playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance . On a small number of occasions law @ - @ break ##ers attempted crimes , but were dealt with by the patrols . Despite all this , the Irish Times reported that " the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols . " Following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week , members of the DC ##AC including Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday , 10 January and called on them to dismant ##le the barric ##ades . The barric ##ades were taken down the following morning .
= = April 1969 = =
Over the next three months there were violent clashes , with local youths throwing stones at police . Violence came to a head on Saturday , 19 April after a planned march from Bur ##nt ##oll ##et Bridge to the city centre was banned . A protest in the city centre led to clashes with " Paisley ##ites " — union ##ists in sympathy with the anti @ - @ civil rights stance of Ian Paisley . Police attempting to drive the protesters back into the Bog ##side were themselves driven back to their barracks . A series of pitched battles followed , and barric ##ades were built , often under the supervision of Bern ##ad ##ette Dev ##lin , newly elected MP for Mid Ulster . Police pursuing rioters broke into a house in William Street and severely beat the occup ##ant , Samuel Dev ##enn ##y , his family and two friends . Dev ##enn ##y was brought to hospital " bleeding prof ##us ##ely from a number of head wounds . " At midnight four hundred R ##UC men in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the Bog ##side . Conv ##oys of police vehicles drove through the area with head ##lights bl ##azing .
The following day , several thousand residents , led by the DC ##AC , withdrew to the C ##reg ##gan and issued an ultimatum to the R ##UC — withdraw within two hours or be driven out . With fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining , the police marched out through the Butcher ' s Gate , even as the residents were entering from the far side . The barric ##ades were not maintained on this occasion , and routine patrols were not prevented .
Samuel Dev ##enn ##y suffered a heart attack four days after his beating . On 17 July he suffered a further heart attack and died . Thousands attended his funeral , and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual App ##rent ##ice Boys ' parade , scheduled for 12 August , could not take place without causing serious disturbance .
= = August – October 1969 = =
The App ##rent ##ice Boys ' parade is an annual celebration by union ##ists of the relief of the Siege of Derry in 1689 , which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city ' s gates against the army of King James . At that time the parade was held on 12 August each year . Particip ##ants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the Bog ##side , and were often openly hostile to the residents . On 30 July 1969 the Derry Citizens Defence Association ( DC ##DA ) was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade , and to defend the Bog ##side and C ##reg ##gan in the event of an attack . The chairman was Se ##án Keenan , an Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) veteran ; the vice @ - @ chairman was P ##addy Do ##herty , a popular local man sometimes known as " P ##addy Bog ##side " and the secretary was John ##nie White , another leading republican and leader of the James Conn ##olly Republican Club . Street committees were formed under the overall command of the DC ##DA and barric ##ades were built on the night of 11 August . The parade took place as planned on 12 August . As it passed through Waterloo Place , on the edge of the Bog ##side , hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade . Fighting between the two groups continued for two hours , then the police joined in . They charged up William Street against the B ##ogs ##iders , followed by the ' Paisley ##ites ' . They were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs . The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of the Bog ##side . Late in the evening , having been driven back repeatedly , the police fired can ##isters of CS gas into the crowd . Youth ##s on the roof of a high @ - @ rise block of flats on Ross ##ville Street threw petrol bombs down on the police . Walk ##ie @ - @ talk ##ies were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and DC ##DA headquarters in P ##addy Do ##herty ' s house in Westland Street , and first aid stations were operating , staffed by doctors , nurses and volunteers . Women and girls made milk @ - @ bottle cr ##ates of petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line and " Radio Free Derry " broadcast to the fighters and their families . On the third day of fighting , 14 August , the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Const ##abulary ( B @ - @ Special ##s ) , a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere . Before they engaged , however , British troops were deployed at the scene , carrying automatic rifles and sub @ - @ machine guns . The R ##UC and B @ - @ Special ##s withdrew , and the troops took up positions outside the barric ##aded area .
A dep ##utation that included E ##am ##onn McCann met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met , including the disarm ##ing of the R ##UC , the disband ##ment of the B @ - @ Special ##s and the abolition of Storm ##ont ( the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland ) . The officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter the Bog ##side and C ##reg ##gan districts . A ' peace corps ' was formed to maintain law and order . When the British Home Secretary , Jim Callaghan , visited Northern Ireland and announced his intention to visit the Bog ##side on 28 August , he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him . Callaghan agreed . Acc ##ompanied by members of the Defence Committee , he was " swept along by a sur ##ging crowd of thousands " up Ross ##v ##ile Street and into Lec ##ky Road , where he " took refuge " in a local house , and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window . In preparation for Callaghan ' s visit the " Free Derry " wall was painted white and the " You are now entering Free Derry " sign was professionally re @ - @ painted in black lettering .
Following Callaghan ' s visit , some barric ##ades were breached , but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform . Still the army made no move to enter the area . Law and order was maintained by a ' peace corps ' — volunteers organised by the DC ##DA to patrol the streets and man the barric ##ades . There was very little crime . Punishment , in the words of E ##am ##onn McCann , " as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from Se ##án Keenan on the need for solidarity within the area . " In September the barric ##ades were replaced with a white line painted on the road .
The Hunt Report on the future of policing in Northern Ireland was presented to the Storm ##ont cabinet in early October . Jim Callaghan held talks with the cabinet in Belfast on 10 October , following which the report ' s recommendations were accepted and made public . They included the recommendation that the R ##UC should be ' ordin ##arily ' unarmed , and that the B @ - @ Special ##s should be phased out and replaced by a new force . The new R ##UC Chief Constable , Arthur Young , an Englishman , was announced , and travelled to Belfast with Callaghan . The same day , Se ##án Keenan announced that the DC ##DA was to be dissolved . On 11 October Callaghan and Young visited Free Derry , and on 12 October the first military police entered the Bog ##side , on foot and unarmed .
= = IRA resurgence = =
The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) had been inactive militarily since the end of the Border Campaign in 1962 . It was low in both personnel and equipment — Chief of Staff Cath ##al Gould ##ing told Se ##án Keenan and P ##addy Do ##herty in August 1969 that he " couldn ' t defend the Bog ##side . I haven ' t the men nor the guns to do it . " During the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left . Its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the Irish nationalist and union ##ist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism , both British and Irish . Republican Clubs were formed in Northern Ireland , where Sinn F ##é ##in was pro ##sc ##ribed . These clubs were involved in the formation of N ##IC ##RA in 1967 . In Derry , the James Conn ##olly Republican Club worked closely with Labour Party radicals , with whom they set up the Derry Housing Action Committee and Derry Un ##employ ##ed Action Committee . The Derry Citizens ' Defence Association was formed initially by republic ##ans , who then invited other nationalists to join . Although there were tensions between the younger leaders like John ##nie White and the older , traditional republic ##ans such as Se ##án Keenan , both sides saw the unrest of 1968 @ - @ 69 as a chance to advance republican aims , and the two shared the platform at the Easter Rising commemoration in April 1969 .
The events of August 1969 in Derry , and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes , brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the traditional ##ists , and led to a split in December 1969 into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Initially , both armies organised for defensive purposes only , although the Provision ##als were planning towards an offensive campaign . In Derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and household ##ers commonly paid subsc ##riptions to both . When rioters were arrested after the Official ' s Easter parade in March 1970 , Officials and Provision ##als pick ##eted their trial together . At the start the Officials attracted most of the younger members . Martin McG ##uin ##ness , who in August 1969 had helped defend the barric ##ades , initially joined the Officials , but a few months later left to join the Provision ##als .
Relations between the British Army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in August 1969 . In September , after clashes between nationalist and union ##ist crowds that led to the death of a Protestant man , William King , the British Army erected a ' peace ring ' to encl ##ose the nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled . Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets . Although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary , there was anger among young people . Cl ##ashes between youths and troops became more frequent . The riot following the Officials ' Easter parade in March 1970 marked the first time that the army used ' sn ##atch squads ' , who rushed into the Bog ##side wielding bat ##ons to make arrests . The sn ##atch squads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations . There was also a belief that they were arresting people at random , sometimes days after the alleged offence , and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance . The rioters were condemned as h ##ool ##igans by moder ##ates , who saw the riots as ham ##pering attempts to resolve the situation . The Labour radicals and Official republic ##ans , still working together , tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations — one such organization was named the Young H ##ool ##igans Association — but to no avail . The Provision ##als , while disappro ##ving of riots , viewed them as the inevitable consequence of British occupation . This philosophy was more attractive to rioters , and some of them joined the Provisional IRA . The deaths of two leading Provision ##als in a premature explosion in June 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization . Nevertheless , up to July 1971 the Provisional IRA remained numer ##ically small .
Two men , Sé ##amas Cus ##ack and Desmond Beat ##t ##ie , were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of 8 July 1971 . They were the first people to be killed by the British Army in Derry . In both cases the British Army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs , while eyewitness ##es insisted that both were unarmed . The Social Democratic and Labour Party ( SD ##L ##P ) , the newly formed party of which John Hume and Ivan Cooper were leading members , withdrew from Storm ##ont in protest , but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed . The result was a surge of support for the IRA . The Provision ##als held a meeting the following Sunday at which they called on people to " join the IRA " . Following the meeting , people que ##ued up to join , and there was large @ - @ scale rioting . The British Army post at Bligh ' s Lane came under sustained attack , and troops there and around the city came under fire from the IRA .
= = Intern ##ment and the third Free Derry = =
The increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that internment without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland , and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of republic ##ans and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids . In Derry , residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests , and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere ; nevertheless leading figures including Se ##án Keenan and John ##nie White were interned . In response , barric ##ades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence . Unlike its predecessors , this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence , both Official and Provisional . It was defended by armed paramil ##itaries — a no @ - @ go area , one in which British security forces were unable to operate .
Gun attacks on the British Army increased . Six soldiers were wounded in the first day after internment , and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either IRA in Derry . The army moved in in force on 18 August to dismant ##le the barric ##ades . A gun battle ensued in which a young Provisional IRA officer , E ##am ##onn Laff ##ert ##y , was killed . A crowd staging a sit @ - @ down protest was h ##osed down and the protesters , including John Hume and Ivan Cooper , arrested . With barric ##ades re @ - @ appearing as quickly as they were removed , the army eventually abandoned their attempt .
The Derry Provision ##als had little contact with the IRA elsewhere . They had few weapons ( about twenty ) which they used mainly for sn ##iping . At the same time , they launched their bombing campaign in Derry . Unlike in Belfast , they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people . E ##am ##onn McCann wrote that " the Derry Prov ##os , under Martin McG ##uin ##ness , had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties . "
Although both IRA ##s operated openly , neither was in control of Free Derry . The barric ##ades were manned by unarmed ' a ##uxili ##aries ' . Crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the Free Derry Police , which was headed by Tony O ' Do ##herty , a Derry footballer and Northern Ireland International .
= = Bloody Sunday = =
An anti @ - @ internment protest organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association ( N ##IC ##RA ) at Mag ##ill ##igan Camp in January 1972 was met with violence from the 1st Battalion , The Parachute Regiment ( 1 Para ) . N ##IC ##RA had organised a march from the C ##reg ##gan to Derry city centre , in defiance of a ban , on the following Sunday , 30 January 1972 . Both IRA ##s were asked , and agreed , to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully . The British Army erected barric ##ades around the Free Derry area to prevent mar ##chers from reaching the city centre . On the day , march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to Free Derry Corner , but some youths proceeded to the barrier at William Street and st ##oned soldiers . Troops from 1 Para then moved into Free Derry and opened fire , killing thirteen people , all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed . A fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in June 1972 . Like the killing of Cus ##ack and Beat ##t ##ie the previous year , Bloody Sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the IRA , even among people who previously would have been ' moder ##ates ' .
= = February - July 1972 = =
Both the Provisional and Official IRA stepped up attacks after Bloody Sunday , with the tac ##it support of the residents . Local feelings changed , however , with the killing of Ranger William Best by the Official IRA . Best was a 19 @ - @ year @ - @ old local man who was home on leave from the British Army at his parents ' house in the C ##reg ##gan . He was abducted , interrogated and shot . The following day 500 women marched to the Republican Club offices in protest . Nine days later , on 29 May , the Official IRA declared a ceasefire . The Provisional IRA initially stated that they would not follow suit , but after informal approaches to the British Government they announced a ceasefire from 26 June . Martin McG ##uin ##ness was the Derry representative in a party of senior Provision ##als who travelled to London for talks with William Whit ##el ##aw , the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland . The talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in Belfast when troops prevented Catholic families from taking over houses in the Len ##ad ##oon estate .
Political pressure for the action against the " no @ - @ go " areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast . A British Army attack was considered inevitable , and the IRA took the decision not to resist it . On 31 July 1972 , Operation Mot ##orman was launched when thousands of British troops , equipped with armoured cars and armoured bulld ##oz ##ers ( AV ##RE ##s ) , dismantled the barric ##ades and occupied the area .
= = Subsequent history = =
After Operation Mot ##orman , the British Army controlled the Bog ##side and C ##reg ##gan by station ##ing large numbers of troops within the area , by conducting large @ - @ scale ' search ' operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering , and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts . Over the following years IRA violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe ' the war was over ' in the area , although there were still frequent street riots . Nationalists — even those who did not support the IRA — remained bitterly opposed to the army and to the state .
Many of the residents ' original grievances were addressed with the passing of the Local Government ( Northern Ireland ) Act , 1972 , which red ##rew the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single transfer ##able vote . Elections were held in May 1973 . Nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since 1923 . Since then the area has been extensively redeveloped , with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats . The Free Derry era is commemorated by the Free Derry wall , the murals of the Bog ##side Artists and the Museum of Free Derry .

Come What ( ever ) May is the second studio album by American alternative metal band Stone Sour . It was recorded and produced by the band and Nick R ##ask ##ulin ##ec ##z at Studio 60 ##6 in Los Angeles , California , and was released on August 1 , 2006 , through Road ##runner Records . Writing for the album began as early as 2003 when vocalist Corey Taylor and guitarist James Root were writing material for their other band , Slipknot . In January 2006 Stone Sour began recording the follow @ - @ up to their 2002 debut album Stone Sour , during which time drummer Joel Ek ##man left the band due to family constraints . He was eventually replaced by ex @ - @ Soul ##fly drummer Roy Mayor ##ga who played on all but two tracks on the album .
Following the release of the album , Stone Sour went on to promote it for over a year ; releasing five singles and touring in several regions , including the United States , Canada , Japan and several countries in Europe . The album received generally positive reviews . It was praised for showing a progression in the band ' s song writing ability and musical style . It was also certified Gold in the United States and Canada and the single " 30 / 30 @ - @ 150 " was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards . On June 26 , 2007 Stone Sour released a special edition version of the album , it included six previously unreleased tracks and a bonus DVD which featured three music videos and a complete live performance of the band in Moscow . It remains their best @ - @ selling album to date , mostly due to the success of the single " Through Glass . "

In September 2005 , lead singer Corey Taylor announced that Stone Sour would return with a second album . He said that they had written over 30 songs , some during the writing process of Vol . 3 : ( The S ##ubl ##iminal Vers ##es ) , the third album by vocalist Taylor and guitarist James Root ' s other band Slipknot , and that they were working on demo ##ing the tracks before entering the studio . Dave Fort ##man was originally slated to produce the album , however , on January 22 , 2006 Stone Sour began working on the album with producer Nick R ##ask ##ulin ##ec ##z at Dave Grohl ' s personal studio ( Studio 60 ##6 ) , in Los Angeles .

Though Rand and Taylor wrote most of the music and lyrics for the first album , respectively , writing for Come What ( ever ) May was done by all members .
Following this , the band set out to record 18 tracks and work began on recording Joel Ek ##man ' s drum tracks . However , Ek ##man was forced to leave the studio after four weeks due to his young son ' s diagnosis of a brain ##stem gl ##i ##oma . With the fate of the album in jeopardy , Stone Sour recruited ex @ - @ Soul ##fly member Roy Mayor ##ga as a session drummer . Mayor ##ga recorded drums for all but two tracks on the album , God ##sm ##ack drummer Shannon Larkin performed on the track " 30 / 30 @ - @ 150 " and guitarist Root performed drums on the bonus track " The Day I Let Go . " In an interview with Revolver during the recording process vocalist Taylor talked about the differences between this album and their previous album , Stone Sour . He said that pressures from fans and the record label were much larger ; also noting that he " thr ##ives on the pressure , because it gets [ him ] going . " While promising that " the album ' s gonna be miles above the first one , " Taylor explained that it is " more melodic and darker " . In late March 2006 , drummer Joel Ek ##man officially left Stone Sour and the band was talking with a few drummers who could replace him . On April 7 , 2006 the recording sessions for Come What ( ever ) May concluded . A month later session drummer Roy Mayor ##ga joined Stone Sour on a full @ - @ time basis .

In an interview with MTV in 2006 , vocalist Corey Taylor said that Come What ( ever ) May was a return to the roots of the band , stating it is " a lot more from the spirit of what the band started with in 1992 . " Noting how some songs were " very atmospheric , " while others maintained " the hard rock and the heavy stuff . " Jon W ##ieder ##horn of MTV said that " for every thrash riff there ' s a tune ##fully gr ##ung ##y passage , for every fl ##ailing guitar line there ' s a rock @ - @ radio hook . " When talking about the track " 30 / 30 @ - @ 150 " , he said parts are " b ##lud ##geoning , barbed and heavy , " while others are " soaring and triumphant , " with the production of R ##ask ##ulin ##ec ##z helping balance the album ' s heav ##iness with its radio @ - @ accessibility . Come What ( ever ) May ' s lyrics include themes of " pain , pleasure , happiness , and grief . " The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album , songs including " Come What ( ever ) May " were politically influenced while the track " Soc ##io " is about " social anxiety attacks " that vocalist Taylor suffered . " Z ##zy ##z ##x Rd " is a love song written to Taylor ' s wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contempl ##ation of suicide . " I ' ve never written anything like that before , but it was very important for me to tell the world not only how much she saved me , but how much she means to me , " said Taylor . Taylor said there is a common thread with the lyrics throughout the album , saying that they are " about never forget ##ting where you came from , who you are and why you do this . "

Come What ( ever ) May was met with generally positive critical reviews . Several reviewers noted on how it helped to further establish Stone Sour . Chad Bower of About . com stated that the band had " progressed a lot since their debut " , noting that the album was " very diverse and [ allows ] the band to show many different sides of their musical personality . " Megan Fry ##e of Allmusic opens her review of the album by distinguishing what sets Stone Sour apart musically , stating " [ it ' s their ] ability to create smooth , radio @ - @ friendly alternative metal songs while simultaneously not boring the people who have heard way too much from post @ - @ grunge groups . " On a similar note , Michael Mel ##ch ##or of 411 ##mania said " the band is much better at the craft of songwriting than many of their peers . " However , in contrast , reviewer William Fry of IGN criticized the album , saying " Stone Sour doesn ' t do anything inspired , original , or fresh here " even calling the album " completely misd ##irect ##ed , and ston ##ew ##alled . " A particular point of interest for reviewers was how Come What ( ever ) May is more melodic than their previous album Stone Sour . Mel ##ch ##or of 411 ##mania said the album is " much more liberal with the ballad ##ry and acoustic sounds than its predecessor , " noting on the track " Sil ##ly ##world " he said " it sounds like what Nickel ##back could be if Chad Kro ##eger could write a good melody " . In his review , Chad Bower labeled Come What ( ever ) May as a " very melodic and accessible album " stating that " it has a little something for everyone . " Similarly , Megan Fry ##e tri ##ump ##hed the album as an " un ##y ##ield ##ing effort from a promising talent " .

Chad sent a delegation of two athletes to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China : Mou ##mi Sé ##berg ##u ##é , who competed in the men ' s 100 meters , and Hin ##ik ##iss ##ia Albert ##ine Nd ##ik ##ert , who competed in the women ' s 100 meters and also bore the Chad ##ian flag during ceremonies . The appearance of this delegation marked the tenth appearance of Chad at the Summer Olympics , the first been in 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , Japan , and its seventh appearance since its Olympic hiatus between 1976 and 1980 . Both Sé ##berg ##u ##é and Nd ##ik ##ert ranked seventh in their respective heats and did not advance past the qualification round . As of the end of the 2012 London Olympics , there have been no medal ##ists from Chad .

Chad is a landl ##ocked country in Africa whose northern region lies within the eastern reaches of the Sahara Desert and whose southern region lies within the eastern portion of the Sa ##hel . It borders Libya to the south , Niger to the east , Sudan to the west , and the Central African Republic to the north . Chad was originally part of French West Africa until 1960 , when it declared independence . Some four years later , the former French colony made its début at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , Japan . For the next three decades , Chad became embroiled in civil war and experienced invasions by Libya and uphe ##av ##als by Sudan ##ese @ - @ backed rebels ; the civil war ended in 1990 , although rebel threats had persisted between then and 2008 . During Chad ' s greatest era of instability , athletes from the country did not attend the 1976 Summer Olympics in Mont ##ré ##al , Canada or the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , USSR , although delegations were sent to all other games between 1964 and 2008 .
The largest Chad ##ian delegation to reach the Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , Spain ; each time , Chad ' s National Olympic Committee sent six athletes . During the 1992 games , the NO ##C sent the nation ' s first female Olymp ##ian . Since then ( and up to the Beijing games ) , at least one woman has been a part of the Chad ##ian delegation . The smallest conting ##ency of Chad ##ian Olymp ##ians occurred during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece , when only K ##alt ##ou ##ma Nad ##jina competed on the country ' s behalf . The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes — one man ( 30 @ - @ year @ - @ old Mou ##mi Sé ##berg ##u ##é ) and one woman ( 15 @ - @ year @ - @ old Hin ##ik ##iss ##ia Albert ##ine Nd ##ik ##ert ) , both participants in track events . Nd ##ik ##ert was Chad ' s flag ##bear ##er at the ceremonies . Up to and including the Beijing games , there has yet to have been a medalist from Chad .

Compet ##itors in athletics events could qualify for the next round of competition in two ways . Qualifying by right was posting a high result in their own heat , and qualifying by result was posting a high result in overall standings . R ##anks shown are thus those within each heat , not in overall standings .
Mou ##mi Sé ##berg ##u ##é represented Chad at the Beijing Olympics in the men ' s 100 meters dash . Born in 1977 , Sé ##berg ##u ##é first participated in the Olympics at age 22 when he raced in the men ' s 100 meters at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , Australia , placing seventh in his qualification heat and not progressing to later rounds . He did not attend the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , Greece , but returned to the Olympics at Beijing at the age of 30 . During the course of the August 14 , 2008 races in his event , when the qualification round took place , Sé ##berg ##u ##é competed in the tenth heat against seven other athletes . He finished the race in 11 @ . @ 14 seconds , placing seventh in the heat ahead of Tu ##val ##u ' s Ok ##inal ##i Tin ##il ##au ( 11 @ . @ 48 seconds ) and behind Gabon ' s Wilf ##ried Bing ##ang ##oye ( 10 @ . @ 87 seconds ) in a heat led by the Netherlands Antilles ' Ch ##ur ##andy Mart ##ina ( 10 @ . @ 35 seconds ) and Japan ' s Na ##oki Ts ##uk ##ah ##ara ( 10 @ . @ 39 seconds ) .

= View of the World from 9th Avenue =
View of the World from 9th Avenue ( sometimes A Par ##och ##ial New Yorker ' s View of the World , A New Yorker ' s View of the World or simply View of the World ) is a 1976 illustration by Saul Stein ##berg that served as the cover of the March 29 , 1976 , edition of The New Yorker . The work presents the view from Manhattan of the rest of the world showing Manhattan as the center of the world .
View of the World has been parodied by Ted R ##all , Columbia Pictures , The New Yorker , The Econom ##ist and Mad Magazine , among others . The work has been imitated and printed without authorization in a variety of ways . The Columbia parody led to a ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Stein ##berg v . Columbia Pictures Industries , Inc . in favor of Stein ##berg because of copyright violations by Columbia Pictures . The work is regarded as one of the greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world .

Saul Stein ##berg created 85 covers and 64 ##2 internal drawings and illustrations for The New Yorker , including its March 29 , 1976 cover , titled " View of the World from 9th Avenue " . This is regarded as his most famous work . It is considered an example of unintention ##al fame : Stein ##berg has noted that the type of fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to " the man who did that poster " . The work is sometimes referred to as A Par ##och ##ial New Yorker ' s View of the World or A New Yorker ' s View of the World because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self @ - @ absorbed New York ##ers . At one point The New Yorker applied for a copyright from the United States Cop ##yr ##ight Office for the work . It assigned the copyright to Stein ##berg and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting .
= = Det ##ail = =
The illustration is split in two parts , with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan ' s 9th Avenue , 10th Avenue , and the Hudson River ( appropriately labeled ) , and the top half depicting the rest of the world . It is a westward view over 10th Avenue . The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a rect ##angle bounded by North American neighbors Canada and Mexico , with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing " Jersey " , the names of five cities ( Los Angeles ; Washington , D . C . ; Las Vegas ; Kansas City ; and Chicago ) and three states ( Texas , Utah , and Nebraska ) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey , which is in bold ##er font than the rest of the country beyond the Hudson . Washington , D . C . is depicted as a remote location near Mexico . The Pacific Ocean , slightly wider than the Hudson , separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China , Japan and Russia . Notably , the image depicts the world with a back turned to Europe , which is absent from the painting .
The work is composed in ink , pencil , colored pencil , and watercol ##or on paper and measures 28 by 19 inches ( 71 cm × 48 cm ) . When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches , the University of Pennsylvania summarized the work as a " bird ' s @ - @ eye view of the city from Ninth Avenue in a straight line westward , with space becoming ever more condensed . . . " They also described the work as a tongue @ - @ in @ - @ cheek view of the world . New York interpreted the New York @ - @ centric mind ' s view of the rest of the world as a set of outer boroughs as iconic . National Post journalist Robert Ful ##ford described the perspective as one in which the entire world is a suburb of Manhattan .

View of the World has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways . The work has been imitated in post ##card format by numerous municipalities , states and nations . Stein ##berg had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting , had they been paid , a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the Moscow on the Hudson use . Ful ##ford , writing in The National Post , noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of Manhattan was " understood and borrowed " by the whole world . Local artists , especially poster artists , presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions . Ful ##ford demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban Ottawa made imitating View of the World an assignment in its graphic arts class . He also noted that the results of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global f ##oci from which the students viewed the world .
The illustration — humor ##ously depicting New York ##ers ' self @ - @ image of their place in the world , or perhaps outs ##iders ' view of New York ##ers ' self @ - @ image — inspired many similar works , including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson ; that movie poster led to a lawsuit , Stein ##berg v . Columbia Pictures Industries , Inc . , 66 ##3 F . Supp . 70 ##6 ( S . D . N . Y . 1987 ) , which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright Stein ##berg held on his work .
On June 5 , 2003 , during the first term of George W . Bush ' s presidency , Ted R ##all presented A View of the World from Pennsylvania Avenue as a Par ##ody of View of the World from 9th Avenue in a Universal Press Syndicate editorial cartoon . He replaced the letters representing The New Yorker with The Bush ##ie .
The cover was later satir ##ized by Barry Bl ##itt for the cover of The New Yorker on October 6 , 2008 . The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska , with Russia in the far background .
The March 21 , 2009 The Econom ##ist included a story entitled " How China sees the World " that presents a parody that is also an homage to the original image , but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing ' s Chang ' an Avenue instead of Manhattan . A caption above the illustration reads " Illust ##ration by Jon Berkeley ( with ap ##ologies to st ##ein ##berg and The New Yorker ) " . It accompanied an article that discussed the burgeoning Chinese economy at the time of the contemporary financial crisis .
The October 1 , 2012 cover of Mad Magazine satir ##ized the problems with the September release of Apple Inc . ' s iOS 6 mobile operating system which included Apple M ##aps , a replacement for Google M ##aps . The work presents what View of the World might look like if one had relied upon the September 2012 version of Apple M ##aps to locate various landmarks .

On October 17 , 2005 , American Society of Magazine Editors unveiled its list of the top 40 magazine covers of the prior 40 years and ranked View of the World from 9th Avenue in fourth place .

Bintulu / bi ##ː ##n ##ˈ ##t ##u ##ː ##lu ##ː / ( Chinese : 民 ##都 ##魯 ; pinyin : M ##í ##nd ##ū ##l ##ǔ ; Pe ̍ h @ - @ ō ##e @ - @ j ##ī : B ##î ##n @ - @ to ͘ - l ##ó ͘ ) is a coastal town on the island of Borneo in the central region of Sarawak , Malaysia . Bintulu is located 610 kilometres ( 380 mi ) northeast of Kuching , 216 kilometres ( 134 mi ) northeast of Sibu , and 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) southwest of Miri . With a population of 114 @ , @ 05 ##8 as of 2010 , Bintulu is the capital of the Bintulu District of the Bintulu Division of Sarawak , Malaysia .
The name of Bintulu was derived from the local native language " Ment ##u Ul ##au " ( picking heads ) . Bintulu was a small fishing village when Raj ##ah James Brooke acquired it in 1861 . Brooke later built a fort there in 1862 . In 1867 , the first General Council meeting ( now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly ) was convened in Bintulu . It is the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia . The construction of the earliest airstrip in Bintulu began in 1934 but was halted in 1938 due to financial difficulties . During World War II , the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces . The British later rebuilt the airstrip , and it became fully operational in 1955 . The old airport was replaced by a new airport in 2002 . Bintulu remained a fishing village until 1969 when oil and gas reserves were discovered off the coast . Since then , Bintulu has become the centre of energy intensive industries such as a Malaysia L ##NG plant , a Shell Middle Dist ##ill ##ate Sy ##nthesis plant , and a Bintulu combined cycle power plant . The economy has also expanded into oil palm and forest plantations , palm oil processing , wood @ - @ waste processing , and cement manufacturing . The port of Bintulu is the busiest in Sarawak . The town is also a gateway to Sam ##al ##aj ##au Industrial Park .
Among the tourist attractions in Bintulu are Sim ##il ##aj ##au National Park , T ##umb ##ina Park , Tan ##j ##ung Bat ##u beach , J ##ep ##ak village , K ##uan Y ##in Tong temple , Assy ##ak ##irin mosque , Council Neg ##ri monument , Tam ##u Bintulu , and Pas ##ar Ut ##ama markets . The Borneo International K ##ite Festival is held annually in the town .
= = Etymology = =
During the 16th century , Bintulu was named " River de Bur ##ulu " by Portuguese cart ##ographers . There are several legends surrounding the name Bintulu . During the Brooke dynasty , the indigenous I ##ban people practised head ##hun ##ting to maintain their social status in the community . They threw the heads into the Kem ##ena River , after which the heads had to be collected from the river . The practice of collecting the heads was known as " Ment ##u Ul ##au " ( picking heads ) in the local native language . Another story relates that two I ##ban warriors named Bern ##ik and J ##el ##ab built houses along the river . They and their followers frequently carried out preservation of severed heads near a small river stream branching off from Seb ##ez ##aw River because the river bank was flat and wide . Therefore , the small river stream was named " Ment ##u Ul ##au " river . Out ##s ##iders who came to Bintulu subsequently pronounced the name as " Ment ##ul ##au " , and later the name evolved into " Bent ##ulu " and , finally , " Bintulu " .
= = History = =
= = = Brooke dynasty = = =
James Brooke was appointed the White Raj ##ah of Sarawak ( now known as Kuching ) by the Brune ##ian Empire in 1841 . In 1861 , the Sultanate of Brunei ceded the Bintulu region to Brooke . Bintulu was a small settlement at that time . A wooden fort named Fort Ke ##pp ##el was built in the village , named after Sir Henry Ke ##pp ##el , who was a close friend of the Raj ##ah James and Charles Brooke . Sir Henry Ke ##pp ##el was responsible for crushing the Day ##ak piracy in the Sar ##ib ##as between 1840 and 1850 . Meanwhile , Charles Brooke was a nephew of James Brooke and would later become the latter ' s successor as the second Raj ##ah of Sarawak . Od ##oard ##o Bec ##c ##ari , an Italian botanist , visited Bintulu in 1867 . On 4 August , he started his journey on a gunboat named " Hearts ##ease " , which was to send $ 6 @ , @ 000 to Brunei for concessions being made to James Brooke in the Muk ##ah and Bintulu regions . He went to Labuan before coming back to Bintulu . He dropped off at Kem ##ena River on 13 August 1867 . His observations of the village were recorded as follows :
The fort of Bintulu which was built entirely of wood , was in somewhat ruin ##ous condition . It stood nearly on the sea @ - @ shore , and just behind it , at a distance of few p ##aces , the prime ##val forests commenced . . . Some chin ##amen had settled at the vicinity of the fort and had built a small b ##azaar ; but the village is chiefly formed by the houses of the Mel ##an ##au beyond the Chinese k ##amp ##ong ( village ) . These Mel ##an ##aus used to live further up the river , but since the construction of the fort , and the installation of an officer of the Raj ##ah near the mouth of the river , they came to settle near the sea – a thing they would never have d ##ared to do in former days for fear of the attacks of the Lan ##un pirates and Day ##ak pirates .
The houses of the Mel ##an ##au people were built in rows on both sides of the Kem ##ena River , mostly furnished by N ##ip ##ah and S ##ago palms . Each house had its own shed projection into the entrance of the river , which was used for the processing of S ##ago palms . On 8 September 1867 , the first Sarawak General Council meeting ( now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly ) took place here . It was made up of 21 elected local community members ( five British officers and 16 Malay and Mel ##an ##au local chiefs ) . The Council was formed by Raja M ##uda Charles Brooke under orders from Raj ##ah James Brooke . The Council is the oldest state legislative assembly in Malaysia .

During World War II , Raj ##ah Charles Vy ##ner Brooke ordered the construction of airstri ##ps in Kuching , O ##ya , Muk ##ah , Bintulu , and Miri . Construction of the Bintulu airstrip was started in 1934 under the direction of C . W . Bailey , a Works and Building Inspector for the British Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . All the airstri ##ps were completed except for the Bintulu airstrip , where construction was discontinued in October 1938 due to financial reasons . Japanese forces landed in Miri on 16 December 1941 . Sarawak fell into Japanese hands when they conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941 . When the Japanese invaded Sarawak , Charles Vy ##ner Brooke already left for Sydney ( Australia ) before the attack while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Bat ##u L ##int ##ang camp . During the Japanese occupation , the Japanese used the airstrip for military purposes . However , the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces . The British began reconstruction of the airstrip after the war ; during the project many unexpl ##oded bombs were unearthed .
On 5 September 1942 , Japanese Field Marshal Prince Maid ##a ( 前 ##田 ##利 ##为 ) boarded a plane from Kuching to Labuan to offic ##iate an airport that bears his name . However , he never arrived . One month later , the plane was found to have crashed off the coast of Tan ##j ##ung Dat ##u , Bintulu . The cause of the plane crash was not known . The Japanese later set up a wooden pole memorial made up of Bel ##ian wood in Bintulu . The wooden pole was later taken back to Japan by the family of Prince Maid ##a .
Chinese sawmill owners at Sibu and Bintulu were instructed by the Japanese to produce timber for repairs at oil fields and ship building . During the Japanese occupation , saw ##mills at Bintulu produced a total of 4 @ , @ 000 tons of s ##awn timber .

In the 1950s , major economic activities in Bintulu were the timber extraction industry , fishing , and S ##ago processing . In the 1960s , Bintulu was still a small fishing village , with a population of 5 @ , @ 000 . No roads were constructed in Bintulu until 1969 when the first unt ##ar ##red road was built to connect Bintulu to Miri . The first bus that serviced the Miri – Bintulu route was owned by Maj ##lis Aman ##ah Rak ##y ##at ( M ##AR ##A ) . The M ##AR ##A bus line was an initiative by the Malaysian federal government to provide public transportation for the people . The I ##ban villagers paid the bus driver with " vegetables , chickens , bamboo shoots , and other items " . Before 1960 , Bintulu was connected to Kuching by sea through a ship named " Sw ##ee Jo ##o " . After 1960 , the ship " Chin Chin " was added to the route . It took around 36 to 48 hours to reach Bintulu from Kuching , depending on the sea conditions . Due to lack of food supplies from Kuching , the villagers had to make do with limited food , and several villagers resorted to hunting in the j ##ung ##les to supplement the food supply .

In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia , ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened . The Yugoslav People ' s Army ( Jug ##oslav ##ens ##ka nar ##od ##na arm ##ija – JNA ) believed Croatia would use the Croatian Territorial Defence Force ' s ( Ter ##itor ##ij ##al ##na ob ##r ##ana – TO ) equipment to build its own army and confront the JNA itself . In order to minimize the expected resistance , the JNA confiscated the TO weapons . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs .
In the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . In an effort to bolster its defence , Croatia doubled the size of its police force to about 20 @ , @ 000 . The most effective part of the force was the 3 @ , @ 000 @ - @ strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions , adopting military organisation . In addition there were 9 @ , @ 000 – 10 @ , @ 000 region ##ally organised reserve police . The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons needed to arm many of the troops .
Preparations to set up the Croatian National Guard ( Z ##bor nar ##od ##ne garde – ZNG ) began on 12 April 1991 . Establishment of the ZNG as a police force with military capabilities was thought necessary by the Croatian authorities following armed clashes in Pak ##rac and at Pl ##it ##v ##ice Lakes in March and due to the possibility of further confrontation with the JNA . The ZNG , formally established on 23 April , was tasked with protection of the constitutional order , maintenance of public order , anti @ - @ terrorist operations , protection of Croatia ' s borders , territory , coast and territorial waters , as well as the protection of high @ - @ value structures and high @ - @ profile persons .

On 18 May 1991 , the Z ##r ##inski Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the ZNG . The core of the unit consisted of 27 volunteers drawn from the Kum ##rov ##ec Special Police Unit ( SP ##U ) . Initially , it relied on former French Foreign Legion troops . The most senior among the former legion ##n ##aires was Ant ##e Ros ##o , previously a Sous @ - @ Offic ##ier ( non @ - @ commissioned officer – NC ##O ) in the 4th Foreign Regiment . In consequence , Ros ##o was tasked with setting up the unit as its initial commander . Major Mil ##j ##enko Filip ##ović , likewise a former French Foreign Legion member , was assigned the battalions deputy commander . The unit was based in the village of Kum ##rov ##ec in the region of Hrvats ##ko Z ##ag ##or ##je , on the grounds of the former " Jos ##ip Bro ##z Tito " political school . The site , adjacent to the border of Slovenia , was selected to be inaccessible to Yugoslav Air Force raids without violation of Slov ##ene or possibly Austrian airspace . In June 1991 , the Kum ##rov ##ec SP ##U was transferred to Sl ##j ##eme Peak north of Zagreb leaving Kum ##rov ##ec base to the Z ##r ##inski Battalion , as well as the second special forces unit , the Frank ##op ##an Battalion .
The Z ##r ##inski Battalion was deployed for the first time on 15 June . It was stationed in Vukovar , tasked with preparation of city defences and organisation of volunteer troops . In August , Filip ##ović took over command of the battalion from Ros ##o . The same month , the Z ##r ##inski Battalion was deployed to the Ban ##ovina , where it pushed the Croatian Serb forces out of the town of Hrvats ##ka Kost ##aj ##nica . In September , the battalion was deployed to Gosp ##ić , where it took part in battle to control Gosp ##ić against the JNA . Troops assigned to the battalion captured K ##ani ##ž ##a barracks in Gosp ##ić . During combat in Gosp ##ić , 30 troops of the Z ##r ##inski Battalion , assisted by Lu ##č ##ko SP ##U , captured JNA Major General Tra ##j ##č ##e Kr ##st ##ev ##ski , along with three armoured personnel carriers ( AP ##Cs ) and 32 soldiers . The unit was deployed to Met ##k ##ović on 28 October , tasked with recapt ##uring Sl ##ano from the JNA . After the deployment to Gosp ##ić , a part of the unit personnel left to Bosnia and Herzegovina anticipating further conflict there , while the remainder of the unit returned to Kum ##rov ##ec . The ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvats ##ka vo ##j ##ska – HV ) on 3 November 1991 . In late 1991 , personnel of the Z ##r ##inski Battalion set up another special forces unit of the HV — the Mat ##ija V ##la ##čić Battalion based in Op ##at ##ija .
In 1992 , elements of the Z ##r ##inski Battalion took part in the Battle of Ku ##pres , before setting up a training camp in the town of Tom ##islav ##grad . There the battalion personnel assisted in setting up and trained the Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvats ##ko v ##ij ##e ##ć ##e ob ##rane – HVO ) . Later that year , elements of the battalion took part in Operation Tiger — aimed at lifting of the Siege of Dubrovnik . In 1993 , elements of the Z ##r ##inski Battalion took part in Operation Mas ##len ##ica , fighting in the area of Š ##k ##ab ##r ##n ##ja . The Central Intelligence Agency assessed the Z ##r ##inski Battalion as one of the best units of the HV .

On 25 February 1994 , the Z ##r ##inski Battalion was amalgamated with parts of other special forces units of the HV : Frank ##op ##an Battalion , Ban J ##ela ##čić Battalion , Mat ##ija V ##la ##čić Battalion , Fer ##do Su ##čić Battalion and part of 8th Light Assault Brigade forming the 1st Croatian Guards Brigade ( 1 @ . @ h ##r ##vats ##ki gard ##ij ##ski z ##d ##rug ) , a component of the 1st Croatian Guards Corps ( 1 @ . @ h ##r ##vats ##ki gard ##ij ##ski z ##bor ) , directly subordin ##ated to the Ministry of Defence rather than the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia .

= Temple Beth Israel ( Eugene , Oregon ) =
Temple Beth Israel ( Hebrew : ב ##י ##ת י ##ש ##ר ##א ##ל ) is a Reconstruction ##ist synagogue located at 117 ##5 East 29th Avenue in Eugene , Oregon . Founded in the early 1930s as a Conservative congregation , Beth Israel was for many decades the only synagogue in Eugene .
The congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on West Eighth Street . It constructed its first building on Portland Street in 1952 , and occupied its current LE ##ED @ - @ compl ##iant facilities in 2008 .
In the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latter leaving Beth Israel , and forming the Orthodox Congregation Ah ##avas Tor ##ah . Beth Israel came under attack from neo @ - @ Nazi members of the Volks ##front twice , in 1994 and again in 2002 . In both cases the perpetrators were caught and convicted .
Services were lay @ - @ led for decades . Marcus Simmons was hired as the congregation ' s first rabbi in 1959 , but left in 1961 . After a gap of two years , Louis Ne ##im ##and became rabbi in 1963 , and served until his death in 1976 . He was followed by My ##ron Kin ##berg , who served from 1977 to 1994 , and Kin ##berg in turn was succeeded by Y ##itz ##h ##ak Hus ##bands @ - @ Hank ##in . Maurice Harris joined Hus ##bands @ - @ Hank ##in as associate rabbi in 2003 , and served until 2011 , when he was succeeded by Boris Dol ##in . As of 2014 , led by Hus ##bands @ - @ Hank ##in and Dol ##in , Beth Israel had approximately 400 member households , and was the largest synagogue in Eugene .
= = Early history = =
Small numbers of German Jews began settling in Eugene in the late 19th century , but most moved on . In the early 20th century the first Eastern European Jews settled there , and by the 1920s Eugene ' s Jewish community began gathering prayer qu ##or ##ums for holding Friday night and Jewish holiday services in individuals ' homes . Historian Steven Low ##enstein writes that " [ a ] f ##ter Hy ##men Rub ##enstein ' s death in 1933 , his home at 231 West Eighth Street was remod ##eled and named Temple Beth Israel " . It was a traditional Conservative synagogue , and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in Eugene .
In 1952 , the congregation constructed a one @ - @ story synagogue building on an almost 1 acre ( 0 @ . @ 40 ha ) property at 25 ##50 Portland Street . Designed by architect and Holocaust @ - @ survivor Heinrich H ##orm ##uth ( H . H . ) Wa ##ech ##ter , the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting , and " a network of ceiling beams painted with symbols and shapes " by Wa ##ech ##ter .
Temple Beth Israel ' s services and religious functions were lay @ - @ led for decades . Its first rabbi was Marcus Simmons . Originally from England , he was a graduate of University of London and Oxford University , and was ordained at the Hebrew Theological Seminary . He emigrated to the United States in 1957 , and joined Beth Israel in 1959 . The members were not , however , agreed that a full @ - @ time rabbi was required , and in 1961 , he accepted a rabb ##in ##ical position in Downey , California .
Following a hiatus of two years , Louis Ne ##im ##and was hired as rabbi in 1963 . Born in New York City in 1912 to immigrant parents , he was a graduate of City University of New York and was ordained at the Jewish Institute of New York . He had previously worked for the United Jewish Appeal , and from 1959 to 1963 was the first Hill ##el rabbi at Syracuse University . There was some concern about Ne ##im ##and ' s hiring , as he had a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the African @ - @ American Civil Rights Movement ( 1955 – 1968 ) . He served until his death in 1976 .
= = Kin ##berg era = =
My ##ron Kin ##berg was hired as rabbi in 1977 . Ord ##ained in Reform Judaism , he had previously served as a rabbi in T ##ope ##ka , Kansas for two years , then lived in Israel for two years , before coming to Eugene . Kin ##berg was known for his support for minority rights and gay rights , anti @ - @ nuclear and anti @ - @ war activism , support of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians , and outreach to non @ - @ observ ##ant members of Eugene ' s Jewish community .
Kin ##berg attempted to revive the Biblical concept of the " g ##er to ##sh ##av " in his approach to inter ##mar ##riage . He was willing to offic ##iate at an inter ##mar ##riage if the non @ - @ Jewish partner , after discussions with the rabbi , agreed of his or her own free will to fulfill a set of commitments , including " a commitment to a Jewish home life , participation in Jewish life and tradition , and raising future children as Jews " . The non @ - @ Jewish partner making this commitment became a " g ##er to ##sh ##av " , or " non @ - @ Jewish member of the Jewish people " .
Kin ##berg ' s wife Alice was a strong feminist , and during the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to the lit ##urgy and ritual . These included allowing women to read from the Tor ##ah and lead the prayers , and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example , using gender @ - @ neutral terms and pronoun ##s for God , and adding references to the Biblical mat ##ri ##archs in prayers like the Amid ##ah , which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarch ##s . While most congregation members approved of these changes , a minority resisted them .
= = = Sch ##ism = = =
By the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over a number of issues , including personal antagon ##isms , the rabbi ' s activism and " advocacy of ' ultra @ - @ liberal ' causes " , political differences over the Israeli – Palestinian conflict , and
a myri ##ad of additional Jewish cultural / religious issues , such as the acceptance of inter ##married couples , adherence to k ##os ##her dietary laws , the use of modern language and music during worship services , rewrit ##ing of certain prayers such as the A ##ley ##n ##u to make them less ethn ##oc ##entric , and so on .
However , the biggest source of division , which under ##lay all others , was " the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue . "
In the early 1990s a group of newly observ ##ant members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue , complete with a m ##ech ##itz ##a , a partition separating men and women . The " more feminist @ - @ minded " members strongly objected to having a m ##ech ##itz ##a anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they attended . The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the m ##ech ##itz ##a would have to be taken down , or those members who wanted it would have to leave . Kin ##berg also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left , rent ##ing new premises and hiring their own rabbi , creating Eugene ' s second synagogue , originally called " The Hal ##ach ##ic Min ##yan " , and in 1998 renamed " Congregation Ah ##avas Tor ##ah " .
Kin ##berg held himself responsible , and the sch ##ism led to his " reass ##essment of the needs of Temple Beth Israel and his role as a rabbi " . As a result , he left Beth Israel in 1994 to lead a synagogue on Long Island . During his tenure at Beth Israel , membership rose from 118 to 350 families . Kin ##berg died two years later at age 51 .

Y ##itz ##h ##ak Hus ##bands @ - @ Hank ##in succeeded Kin ##berg in 1995 . Hus ##bands @ - @ Hank ##in began his involvement at Temple Beth Israel first as a congreg ##ant , then as cant ##or , and then as an assistant rabbi . He was active in forming the Jewish Renew ##al movement , and was ordained by its leader Z ##al ##man Sch ##ach ##ter @ - @ Shal ##omi .
The congregation decided to leave the Conservative movement in 1995 , and for a year had no affiliation . In late 1996 , after considering both Reform and Reconstruction ##ist as alternatives , the congregation affiliated with the Reconstruction ##ist movement . By 1999 , membership had grown to around 370 families .
Hus ##bands @ - @ Hank ##in was instrumental in developing the concept of " Eth ##ical Kash ##r ##ut " , the idea that one should only purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way . His essay , " Eth ##ical Kash ##r ##ut , " was selected for publication in Arthur Kur ##z ##we ##il ' s Best Jewish Writing 2003 . A singer , cello and guitar player , he comp ##oses and performs Jewish music .
Hus ##bands @ - @ Hank ##in has had four assistant or associate rabb ##is working with him .

Originally sized for 75 families , Temple Beth Israel ' s Portland Street building had been renovated and enlarged over the years to 7 @ , @ 500 square feet ( 700 m2 ) to accommodate 250 families and 150 students . Despite these additions and the loss of members to Congregation Ah ##avas Tor ##ah , the synagogue was not large enough , particularly during the High Hol ##idays , when extra space had to be rented . In 1997 the congregation purchased the property of the University Street Christian Church for $ 500 @ , @ 000 ( today $ 740 @ , @ 000 ) , and began planning for a new facility . The members considered renov ##ating the existing building on the property , but felt a new building would better suit their requirements , and razed the church .
In 2003 the congregation got a permit to begin construction of a new facility on the now @ - @ vacant 1 @ . @ 37 @ - @ acre ( 0 @ . @ 55 ha ) plot of land at the northwest corner of East 29th Avenue and University Street . An initial capital campaign raised more than $ 1 @ . @ 8 million , which fully paid for the land , and by August 2007 an additional $ 1 @ . @ 7 million had been raised towards anticipated overall project costs of $ 5 million .
The environmentally sensitive building was designed by Mel Solomon and Associates of Kansas City and local company TB ##G Architects & Pl ##anners , and built by McKenzie Commercial Construction of Eugene . The building used " energy efficient heating , ventilation and lighting " : specific design issues with the building ' s energy efficiency included the fact that the largest room in the building , the sanctuary , was also the least @ - @ used , and , in accord with Jewish tradition , had to face east ( towards Jerusalem ) .
On June 8 , 2008 the congregation dedicated its new building at 117 ##5 East 29th Avenue . At approximately 25 @ , @ 000 square feet ( 2 @ , @ 300 m2 ) , the facility included a sanctuary , commercial kitchen , banquet facilities , and classrooms , and housed the synagogue , the Lane County Jewish Federation , and the local Jewish Family Service . The project ended up costing $ 6 million , of which $ 4 million had been raised .
Made of concrete , steel , and wood , the building achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design compliance " through the integration of storm ##water management strategies , high efficiency irrigation , the use of recycled and / or recy ##cl ##able materials , and drought tolerant plant ##ings .

Organ ##ized by Rabb ##is for Human Rights — North America in honor of Tort ##ure A ##war ##eness Month , the Jewish campaign included over 25 syn ##ag ##ogues which hung banners protesting " the use of abusive interrogation techniques by the American military and intelligence community " . That year , congreg ##ational membership reached almost 400 families , and the Tal ##mud Tor ##ah and pre @ - @ school had about 200 and 40 students respectively .
The congregation sold the old synagogue building on Portland Street to Security First ( Portland Street ) Child Development Center for $ 815 @ , @ 000 in 2009 , carrying the Center ' s financing . The building was converted for use as an educational center , while retaining some of the original architectural elements .

Harris announced he would be stepping down as rabbi in 2011 , and the synagogue hired Boris Dol ##in as his successor . Born and raised in Oregon , Dol ##in had worked at Temple Beth Israel as a teacher and youth group adviser from 1999 to 2001 .

= New York State Route 93 =
New York State Route 93 ( NY 93 ) is a 43 @ . @ 08 @ - @ mile ( 69 @ . @ 33 km ) state highway in western New York in the United States . The route begins at an intersection with NY 18 ##F in the village of Youngstown and runs in a general northwest – southeast direction across Niagara and Erie counties to its east end at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of New ##stead , just south of the village of Akron . NY 93 serves as a connector between several major arter ##ials , including NY 104 in Camb ##ria , NY 31 just west of the city of Lock ##port , and NY 78 south of the city .
The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Although it began in Youngstown and ended in New ##stead as it does today , the initial routing of NY 93 dev ##iated from the modern path in the vicinity of the city of Lock ##port . From Camb ##ria to Lock ##port ' s eastern suburbs , the highway originally used NY 425 , Lower Mountain Road , Akron Road , and a series of streets in Lock ##port . NY 93 was moved onto NY 104 and Junction Road in Camb ##ria in the 1940s , and altered to bypass Lock ##port to the south on a new highway and Robinson and D ##ys ##inger roads in 1991 . In 2006 , NY 93 was realigned west of Lock ##port to continue south on Junction Road to NY 31 . The change removed NY 93 from Upper Mountain Road , a county @ - @ owned highway that had been part of the route since the 1930s .

= = = West of Lock ##port = = =
NY 93 begins at an intersection with NY 18 ##F ( Main Street ; co @ - @ designated but not signed as County Route 90 ##7 or CR 90 ##7 ) in the center of the village of Youngstown . The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two @ - @ lane road named Lock ##port Street , serving two blocks of commercial areas before bending to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of Youngstown . At the eastern village limits , NY 93 briefly widens to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway . Past the junction , the highway rever ##ts to a two @ - @ lane road and changes names to Youngstown – Lock ##port Road as it runs across the town of Porter . The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners , where NY 93 connects to NY 18 ( Creek Road ) .
After NY 18 , NY 93 curves to the southeast , serving another residential stretch ahead of a junction with Youngstown – Wilson Road ( CR 36 ) on the eastern edge of Towers Corners . After this intersection , the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town . The route continues on a southeast track through Porter , passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center , where NY 93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road ( CR 57 ) . Another southeastward stretch brings the route across Tw ##el ##v ##em ##ile Creek and into the hamlet of R ##ans ##om ##ville , where NY 93 becomes the community ' s main street . Through R ##ans ##om ##ville , NY 93 retains the Youngstown – Lock ##port Road name , intersecting with R ##ans ##om ##ville Road ( CR 17 ) in the hamlet ' s business district .
Just outside R ##ans ##om ##ville , NY 93 leaves the town of Porter for the town of Wilson . It continues generally southeastward across mostly open terrain , meeting Randall Road ( CR 83 ) and Church Street ( CR 56 ) on its way to the town of Camb ##ria . NY 93 becomes North Ridge Road at the town line , and it soon enters the hamlet of North Ridge , a community built up around the route ' s intersection with NY 425 ( Camb ##ria – Wilson Road ) . The hamlet ' s residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community of Mol ##yne ##aux Corners , where NY 93 becomes concurrent with NY 104 ( Ridge Road ) . NY 93 and NY 104 proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for 2 miles ( 3 @ . @ 2 km ) to the hamlet of Warren Corners , at which point NY 93 splits from NY 104 and heads southward along Town Line Road .

Outside of Warren Corners , the route heads across rural areas along the Camb ##ria – Lock ##port town line . It soon enters the small hamlet of Hick ##ory Corners , where the road passes under Lower Mountain Road ( CR 902 ) . Access to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur ( CR 114 ) , a connector leading to Lower Mountain Road . NY 93 continues southward along the town line , changing names to Junction Road at an intersection with Upper Mountain Road ( CR 5 ) west of the city of Lock ##port . From here , the route crosses over CSX Transportation ' s Lock ##port Subdivision rail line at the hamlet of Lock ##port Junction before intersecting with NY 31 ( Saunders Settlement Road ) and NY 270 ( Campbell Boulevard ) just south of the community . NY 270 begins straight ahead to the south while NY 93 turns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road , beginning a concurrency with NY 31 .
Now fully in the town of Lock ##port , NY 31 and NY 93 proceed northeast through an open area of the town as a four @ - @ lane divided highway . The two routes continue to the western edge of the city of Lock ##port , where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the Lock ##port Bypass . The overlap ends here as NY 93 turns southeastward onto the two @ - @ lane bypass . Along the bypass , NY 93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with Hin ##man Road ( CR 90 ##3 ) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal . Past the waterway , the bypass takes a more southerly course through an undeveloped part of the town of Lock ##port to a junction with Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) on the Lock ##port – Pendleton town line . The Lock ##port Bypass ends here , leaving NY 93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road .
The route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along Robinson Road ; however , it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road ' s intersection with NY 78 ( Transit Road ) . At this point , the Lock ##port – Pendleton town line turns south to follow NY 78 , leaving NY 93 fully within the town of Lock ##port as it runs eastward past another stretch of homes . Not far from NY 78 , NY 93 changes names to D ##ys ##inger Road at an intersection with Beat ##t ##ie Avenue ( CR 14 ) and Raymond Road ( CR 85 ) . The junction also marks a shift in the road ' s surroundings as the homes give way to open , rolling terrain . NY 93 continues eastward for several miles to the town of Royal ##ton , where it meets R ##iddle Road ( CR 35 ) and Akron Road ( CR 142 ) at adjacent intersections just east of the town line .

NY 93 takes over Akron Road ' s name and right @ - @ of @ - @ way , continuing eastward past a line of scattered homes to reach the sparsely developed hamlet of D ##ys ##inger . Here , the route turns southward at a junction with Bunker Hill Road ( CR 136 ) . Outside of D ##ys ##inger , NY 93 heads southeastward across undeveloped areas of Royal ##ton , connecting to Block Church Road ( CR 110 ) as it approaches Ton ##aw ##anda Creek and the Niagara – Erie county line . The road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about 1 @ . @ 5 miles ( 2 @ . @ 4 km ) prior to curving southward at an intersection with Wol ##cot ##ts ##ville Road ( CR 122 ) . The turn brings NY 93 across Ton ##aw ##anda Creek and into the Erie County town of New ##stead , where it becomes known as Maple Road and immediately intersects with CR 260 ( Ko ##ep ##sel Road ) .
Continuing southward , NY 93 runs across open , rolling terrain , meeting CR 259 ( Ton ##aw ##anda Creek Road ) on its way to the hamlet of Sw ##ifts Mills . Here , the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as NY 93 intersects with CR 255 ( Swift Mills Road ) in the center of the community . South of Sw ##ifts Mills , the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 miles ( 3 @ . @ 2 km ) , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR 253 ( Car ##ney Road ) and CR 42 ( Rapids Road ) . It continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR 218 ( Hunts Corner – Akron Road ) to the outskirts of the village of Akron , where the highway turns east onto Lewis Road and soon enters the village limits . NY 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street , a road maintained by Erie County as CR 261 north of the village .
The route turns south at Cedar Street , following the residential street into downtown Akron . Here , NY 93 intersects with CR 57 ##3 ( John Street ) at a junction that was once the western terminus of NY 267 . At this intersection , NY 93 heads west on John Street for one block before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block to Main Street . NY 93 turns westward again , following Main Street through the westernmost part of Akron ' s central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with Mechan ##ic Street . The highway takes on the Mechan ##ic Street name as it crosses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown Akron . Just south of the creek , NY 93 changes names to Bu ##ell Street at an intersection with Jackson Street .
As the route continues southward through the southern part of Akron , it serves mostly residential areas , save for an industrial complex at NY 93 ' s intersection with CR 163 ( Clarence Center Road ) and CR 167 ( Park ##view Drive ) . NY 93 exits Akron a short distance south of the junction , at which point the route heads into another area of open fields while retaining the Bu ##ell Street name . It continues on a southward track for about 1 mile ( 1 @ . @ 6 km ) to a commercial ##ized intersection with NY 5 ( Main Road ) , where Bu ##ell Street and NY 93 both come to an end .

= = = Design ##ation and early changes = = =
NY 93 was established as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , connecting the cities and villages of Youngstown , Lock ##port , and Akron . While the termini of NY 93 have remained the same to this day , several portions of the route have been realigned since that time . When NY 93 was first assigned , it turned south at the hamlet of North Ridge and overlapped with NY 425 along Camb ##ria – Wilson Road to Lower Mountain Road , then part of NY 3 . NY 425 went west from this junction while NY 93 headed eastward , following NY 3 along Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , Upper Mountain , and Saunders Settlement roads to the city of Lock ##port . At Locust Street , NY 93 left NY 3 and exited the city along Locust , High , and Akron streets and Akron Road . It met its current alignment southeast of the city in Royal ##ton .
NY 3 was realigned c . 1932 to follow Saunders Settlement Road between Shawnee Road ( NY 425 ) and Upper Mountain Road . The former routing of NY 3 along Shawnee , Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain roads was redesignated as NY 3 ##A even though all of NY 3 ' s former routing was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93 . The NY 3 ##A designation was eliminated c . 1935 when NY 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central New York . In the early 1940s , NY 93 was altered to follow North Ridge Road , U . S . Route 104 ( now NY 104 ) , and Junction Road between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Road .
Around the same time that NY 93 was rerouted , NY 270 was also extended northward along Junction Road from NY 31 to US 104 . As a result , NY 93 overlapped NY 270 between Lower Mountain Road and US 104 . The overlap with NY 270 remained in place until c . 1963 when NY 270 was truncated southward to the intersection of Lower Mountain and Junction roads . NY 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass Lower Mountain and Gothic Hill Roads on Junction and Upper Mountain roads , replacing NY 270 along Junction Road . The Lower Mountain Road portion of NY 93 ' s former routing is now maintained by Niagara County as County Route 902 ( CR 902 ) .
= = = Lock ##port real ##ign ##ments = = =
The Lock ##port Bypass , a highway bypassing downtown Lock ##port to the southwest , was opened to traffic on July 26 , 1991 . The highway cost $ 7 @ . @ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @ . @ 4 million in 2016 ) to construct and extended from the junction of NY 31 and NY 93 west of the city to Robinson Road south of downtown . NY 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to Robinson Road , where it turned east and followed Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) and D ##ys ##inger Road ( CR 133 ) to Akron Road in Royal ##ton . The portion of Akron Road ( NY 93 ' s former routing ) east of the Lock ##port city limits became NY 95 ##4 ##M , an unsigned reference route .
Own ##ership and maintenance of Robinson Road from the bypass to NY 78 was transferred from Niagara County to the state of New York on September 1 , 1990 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . The portion of NY 93 between NY 78 and Akron Road became state @ - @ maintained on October 1 , 1998 , as part of another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance of Akron Road to Niagara County . Akron Road is now CR 142 .
On November 1 , 2005 , the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation ( NY ##S ##DOT ) to remove the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road , a county @ - @ maintained highway , and reass ##ign it to Junction Road ( NY 270 ) and Saunders Settlement Road ( NY 31 ) . The impetus for the change came from a resident of Upper Mountain Road , who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway . This part of the agenda was passed . NY ##S ##DOT obliged to the request in 2006 , rer ##out ##ing NY 93 as proposed and trunc ##ating NY 270 southward to NY 31 .

= Typhoon K ##rosa ( 2013 ) =
Typhoon K ##rosa , known in the Philippines as Typhoon V ##inta , was a typhoon that made landfall in the northern Philippines in late October 2013 . Form ##ing on October 27 near Guam , the storm slowly intensified while moving westward . K ##rosa developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking Luzon on October 31 . The storm weakened over land , but re @ - @ intensified over the South China Sea , reaching peak winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on November 2 off the southeast coast of China . Typhoon K ##rosa stalled and encountered unfavorable conditions , resulting in quick weakening . By November 3 , it had weakened to tropical storm status , and was no longer being warned on by the next day . In northern Luzon , K ##rosa damaged 32 @ , @ 000 houses , including 3 @ , @ 000 that were destroyed , and caused four fatalities . High winds and rainfall left P ##27 ##7 million ( PHP , $ 6 @ . @ 4 million USD ) in damage .
= = Meteorological history = =
On October 27 , an area of convection with a broad circulation persisted southeast of Guam , and slowly consolidated due to moderate wind shear and westerly outflow . That day , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression about 380 km ( 235 mi ) to the southeast of Hag ##å ##t ##ña , Guam . At 2100 UTC on October 28 , the Philippine Atmospheric , Ge ##ophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) began issuing advisories on the depression , giving it the local name V ##inta . The next day , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm K ##rosa ( 132 ##9 ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) also classified it as Tropical Depression 29 ##W . By that time , the storm was moving steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north . With the warm waters of the Philippine Sea , less ##ening wind shear , and improving outflow , K ##rosa gradually strengthened , and the JTWC also upgraded K ##rosa to tropical storm status on October 30 after an eye feature developed .
While approaching northern Luzon on October 29 , K ##rosa quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well @ - @ defined eye . Late on October 30 , the JTWC upgraded K ##rosa to typhoon status , and the next day , both PAGASA and JMA followed suit . On October 31 , K ##rosa made landfall in northeastern Luzon near Cag ##ayan , and developed a symmetric eyewall while initially moving over land . Land interaction weakened the eye by the time K ##rosa emerged into the South China Sea late on October 31 . The next day , PAGASA discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region . Convection rebuilt around the center , with continued favorable conditions allowing for restr ##engthening .
Late on November 1 , a large eye redeveloped , and the JTWC estimated K ##rosa attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Early the next day , the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Later , increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate , and K ##rosa began slowing about 260 km ( 160 mi ) east @ - @ southeast of Hong Kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge . After remaining nearly stationary , K ##rosa began moving steadily to the west @ - @ southwest due to a new ridge . The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from up ##w ##elling , and K ##rosa deteriorated to tropical storm status on November 3 . The next day , the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection . Also on November 4 , the JMA downgraded K ##rosa to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast . The system dissipated at 0000 UTC on November 5 .
= = Preparations and impact = =
Before K ##rosa struck the Philippines , PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for portions of northern Luzon , where winds were expected to reach over 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides . High winds knocked down trees across Luzon , and left about 80 % of Cag ##ayan province without power , as well as some areas without internet or cell ##phone service . Portions of the Pan @ - @ Philippine Highway were blocked , and in Lal @ - @ Lo , Cag ##ayan , a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages . Agriculture damage was estimated at P ##27 ##3 million ( PHP , $ 6 @ . @ 3 million USD ) , occurring just before the start of the harvest . Across the island , the typhoon damaged 32 @ , @ 74 ##5 houses , including 3 @ , @ 83 ##7 that were destroyed , forcing 65 @ , @ 64 ##8 people to evacuate to storm shelters . Overall , K ##rosa killed four people in the Philippines , and left P ##27 ##3 million ( PHP , $ 6 @ . @ 4 million USD ) in damage . After the storm , workers quickly restored power lines , while the government provided monetary assistance to storm @ - @ ravaged families , after Cag ##ayan was declared a state of cal ##am ##ity . Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm .
The China National Meteorological Centre issued a " yellow alert " , the second @ - @ lowest of the four level warning system , for Hain ##an due to the threat of the storm . The agency recommended boats to return to port . Ag ##encies in Vietnam also warned for the potential of heavy rainfall due to the dissipating Tropical Depression K ##rosa , and released water from three dams to prevent overflow .

Kirby ' s Block Ball is a 1995 action video game , a spin @ - @ off from the Kirby series for the Game Boy portable console . It is a Breakout clone ; the player controls padd ##les along the screen ' s edge to knock a bouncing ball , Kirby , into destruct ##ible bricks . The game ' s 55 levels include power @ - @ ups , bonus rounds , and minigames . Kirby ' s Block Ball was developed by H ##AL Laboratory and Nintendo R & D ##1 . The team spent half a year rev ##ising the gameplay to match Kirby ' s signature characteristics . Kirby ' s Block Ball was published by Nintendo first in Japan in 1995 , later in Europe , and last in North America in 1996 .
Reviewers considered the game an improvement on the Breakout formula and praised its gameplay crafts ##manship and incorporation of the Kirby series . It was included in multiple top Game Boy game lists and was later emulated on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console .
= = Gameplay = =
The player controls padd ##les along the screen ' s edges to knock a bouncing ball , Kirby , into destruct ##ible bricks . The player loses a life if Kirby hits the edge of the screen . Each of the game ' s eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for Kirby to clear . The ten different block types vary in dur ##ability and points value . A well @ - @ timed hit of the paddle gives Kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks . Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time . The player can find warp stars that lead to minigames , such as air hockey , where the player can earn extra lives . The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid . Some enemies contain bonus items . Each stage ends in a boss fight .
With stone , needle , flame , and spark power @ - @ ups , Kirby can transform to interact with blocks differently . For instance , the spark power @ - @ up lets Kirby break through otherwise ind ##est ##ruct ##ible blocks , and the needle lets Kirby hit spikes once without losing a life . The game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in @ - @ game when played with the Super Game Boy .

Nintendo Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its number of stages , but wondered how its eight meg ##ab ##its of memory were being used . The magazine found the parts where Kirby eats the un ##break ##able blocks to be innovative . All six of the magazine ' s reviewers recommended the game .
IGN wrote that the game was primarily remembered as " an Ark ##an ##oid or Breakout clone skinned with the Kirby franchise " . IGN calculated an average reviewer score of 7 @ . @ 4 / 10 . The Kirby series became known for its number of non @ - @ platform ##er spin @ - @ offs , of which Block Ball was one , like Kirby ' s Pin ##ball Land and Kirby ' s Dream Course . Kirby ' s spherical shape lent itself towards ball @ - @ like roles . IGN wrote that Block Ball was the first " truly out there " Kirby spin @ - @ off , but that the game was too short .
Planet Game Boy called it one of the original Game Boy ' s ten " all @ - @ time classics " and GamesRadar placed it among the top 25 Game Boy games released . They considered Kirby ' s Block Ball an improvement upon Alley ##way , a Game Boy launch title and Breakout clone . IGN recommended the game upon its 3DS rer ##el ##ease both in general and for Breakout fans . Nintendo World Report recommended the game to players who like score attack games and called it the best version of Breakout released . Retro ##spective reviewers found the game enjoyable and praised the craft behind the gameplay and Kirby themes .

= = = World War I = = =
On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Fabian Ware , a director of the Rio Tint ##o Company , found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Rio Tint ##o chairman , Viscount Milner , to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of Nev ##il Mac ##ready , Adj ##utant @ - @ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware ' s work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves Registration Commission . The new Graves Registration Commission had over 31 @ , @ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @ , @ 000 registered by May 1916 .
When municipal grave ##yards began to over ##fill Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further cemeteries . Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French cemeteries under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not pr ##ud ##ent to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in perpet ##uity , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that cemeteries respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government .
As reports of the grave registration work became public , the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers . By 1917 , 17 @ , @ 000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives . In March 1915 , the Commission , with the support of the Red Cross , began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests . The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and En ##quiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to en ##quiries from relatives of those killed . The director ##ate ' s work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war , with units deployed in Greece , Egypt and Mesopotamia .

As the war continued , Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post @ - @ war period . Following a suggestion by the British Army , the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was appointed by the British government in January 1916 , with Edward , Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as president . The National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the Directorate of Graves Registration and En ##quiries after the war . The government felt that it was more appropriate to entr ##ust the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department . By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves . With the help of Edward , Prince of Wales , Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted . The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter , with the Prince of Wales serving as president , Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman and Ware as vice @ - @ chairman . The Commission ' s undert ##akings began in earnest at the end of the First World War . Once land for cemeteries and memorials had been guaranteed , the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin . By 1918 , some 58 ##7 @ , @ 000 graves had been identified and a further 55 ##9 @ , @ 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave .
The scale , and associated high number of casualties , of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead . Previous to World War I , individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers . However , the war required mobil ##isation of a significant percentage of the population , either as volunteers or through conscription . An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated , even if they were low @ - @ ranking members of the military . A committee under Frederic Kenyon , Director of the British Museum , presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries . Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatri ##ated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions . Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses , it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brother ##hood that had developed between serving ranks .
An article in The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rud ##yard Kip ##ling carried the Commission ' s proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like . The article entitled War Graves : Work of Imperial Commission : Mr . Kip ##ling ' s Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet , Graves of the Fallen . The illustrated booklet was intended to soft ##en the impact of Kenyon ' s report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs ; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos . There was an immediate public outcry following the publication of the reports , particularly with regards to the decision to not repatri ##ate the bodies of the dead . The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920 . Sir James Rem ##nant started the debate , followed by speeches by William Burd ##ett @ - @ Cout ##ts in favour of the Commission ' s principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those des ##iring repatriation and opposing uniform ##ity of grave markers . Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote . Rem ##nant withdrew his motion , allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles .
= = = First cemeteries and memorials to the missing = = =
Three of the most eminent architects of their day , Sir Herbert Baker , Sir Reginald Blom ##field , and Sir Edwin L ##uty ##ens were commissioned to design the cemeteries and memorials . Rud ##yard Kip ##ling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions .
In 1920 , the Commission built three experimental cemeteries at Le Tre ##port , Force ##ville and Lou ##ven ##court , following the principles outlined in the Kenyon report . Of these , the Force ##ville Commun ##al Cemetery and Extension was agreed to be the most successful . Having consulted with garden designer Gertrude Je ##ky ##ll , the architects created a walled cemetery with uniform head ##stones in a garden setting , augmented by Blom ##field ' s Cross of Sacrifice and L ##uty ##ens ' Stone of Remembrance . After some adjustments , Force ##ville became the template for the Commission ' s building programme . Ad ##just ##ments were required because all three experimental cemeteries went over budget . To ensure future cemeteries remained within their budget the Commission decided to not build shelters in cemeteries that contained less than 200 graves , to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves , and to limit the height of cemetery walls to 1 metre ( 3 @ . @ 3 ft ) .
At the end of 1919 , the Commission had spent £ 7 @ , @ 500 , and this figure rose to £ 250 @ , @ 000 in 1920 as construction of cemeteries and memorials increased . By 1921 , the Commission had established 1 @ , @ 000 cemeteries which were ready for head ##stone erect ##ions , and burials . Between 1920 and 1923 , the Commission was shipping 4 @ , @ 000 head ##stones a week to France . In many cases small cemeteries were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones . By 1927 , when the majority of construction had been completed , over 500 cemeteries had been built , with 400 @ , @ 000 head ##stones , a thousand Cross ##es of Sacrifice , and 400 Stones of Remembrance .
The Commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave , which amounted to 315 @ , @ 000 in France and Belgium alone . The Commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing ; each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the Western Front . After resistance from the French committee responsible for the appro ##v ##als of memorials on French territory , the Commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials , and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing cemeteries rather than as separate structures .
Reginald Blom ##field ' s Men ##in Gate was the first memorial to the missing located in Europe to be completed , and was unveiled on 24 July 1927 . The Men ##in Gate ( Men ##en ##po ##ort ) was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34 @ , @ 98 ##4 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker ' s Tyne Cot Memorial to the Missing . Other memorials followed : the Hell ##es Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet ; the Th ##iep ##val Memorial on the Somme and the Ar ##ras Memorial designed by Edwin L ##uty ##ens ; and the Bas ##ra Memorial in Iraq designed by Edward Pri ##ole ##au Warren . The Domin ##ions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing : the Ne ##uve @ - @ Chap ##elle Memorial for the forces of India , the Vim ##y Memorial by Canada , the Vill ##ers @ - @ Breton ##ne ##ux Memorial by Australia , the Del ##ville Wood Memorial by South Africa and the Beaumont @ - @ Ham ##el Memorial by Newfoundland . The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of the Th ##iep ##val Memorial in 1932 , though the Vim ##y Memorial would not be finished until 1936 , the Vill ##ers @ - @ Breton ##ne ##ux Memorial until 1938 and ston ##em ##asons were still conducting work on the Men ##in Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940 .
The only memorial created by the Commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the Op ##th ##th ##alm ##ic Institute at G ##iza , Egypt — complete with library , and bacter ##iology and path ##ology departments — as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps . Its erection was agreed with local political pressure .
= = = World War II = = =
From the start of the Second World War in 1939 , the Commission organised grave registration units and , planning ahead based on the experience gained from the First World War , earmarked land for use as cemeteries . When the war began turning in favour of the Allies , the Commission was able to begin restoring its First World War cemeteries and memorials . It also began the task of commemorating the 600 @ , @ 000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War . In 1949 , the Commission completed Die ##ppe Canadian War Cemetery , the first of 55 ##9 new cemeteries and 36 new memorials . Eventually , over 350 @ , @ 000 new head ##stones were erected . Many were made from Hop ##ton Wood stone . The wider scale of World War II , coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries , meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer . Following the war , the Commission implemented a five @ - @ year hort ##icultural renovation programme . The hort ##icultural neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made . These , together with the back ##log of maintenance tasks from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s .
With the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the World War I , Winston Churchill agreed to Ware ' s proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths . A supplement ##al chapter was added to the Imperial War Graves Commission ' s charter on 7 February 1941 , empower ##ing the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War , which resulted in the creation of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour . The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67 @ , @ 000 civilians . The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended . The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956 ; the final volume was added to the showcase in 1958 .
= = = Post – World War II = = =
Following World War II the Commission recognised that the word ' Imperial ' within its name was no longer appropriate . In the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation ' s name was changed to Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 1960 .
More recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the Commission to care for cemeteries in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether . Ze ##hr ##ens ##dorf Indian Cemetery in Germany was un ##k ##em ##pt after the end of World War II and until the German reun ##ification because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 . The Six @ - @ Day War and War of Att ##rition resulted in the destruction of Port T ##ew ##f ##ik Memorial and Aden Memorial , and the death of a Commission gardener at Suez War Memorial Cemetery . During the Lebanese Civil War two cemeteries in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt . The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iran – Iraq War in the 1980s , with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War .
The Commission has , and continues to , also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate . In 1982 , the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission ' s assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the Falklands War . Although these cemeteries are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries , the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these cemeteries . Since 2005 , the Commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the British Ministry of Defence for cemeteries and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War . In 2003 , Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility . As of 2011 , the Commission conducts a twelve @ - @ year cycl ##ical inspection programme of Canadian veterans ' markers installed at the expense of the Government of Canada .
In 2008 , an explor ##atory excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of P ##he ##asant Wood outside of From ##elles . Two @ - @ hundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed From ##elles ( P ##he ##asant Wood ) Military Cemetery . This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years , the last such cemeteries having been built after the Second World War .
= = Bur ##ial sites and memorials = =
The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1 @ . @ 7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67 @ , @ 000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II . Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a head ##stone , at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial . As a result , the Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23 @ , @ 000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide . The vast majority of burial sites are pre @ - @ existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish church ##yards located in the United Kingdom , however the Commission has itself constructed approximately 2 @ , @ 500 war cemeteries worldwide . The Commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave ; the largest of these is the Th ##iep ##val Memorial .
= = = Qual ##ifications for inclusion = = =
The Commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years , while in Commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service . The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First World War and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 for the Second World War . The end date for the First World War period is the official end of the war , while for the Second World War the Commission selected a date approximately the same period after V ##E Day as the official end of the First World War was after the 1918 Armistice .
Civil ##ians who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service . They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George ' s Chapel in Westminster Abbey . In addition to its mandated duties , the Commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @ , @ 000 non @ - @ Commonwealth war graves and over 25 @ , @ 000 non @ - @ war military and civilian graves .
= = = Architects and sculpt ##ors = = =
As well as the main Principal Architects for France and Belgium ( Baker , Blom ##field and L ##uty ##ens ) , there were Principal Architects appointed for other regions as well . Sir Robert Lor ##imer was Principal Architect for Italy , Macedonia and Egypt , while Sir John James Burnet was Principal Architect for Palestine and Gallipoli , assisted by Thomas Smith T ##ait . The Principal Architect for Mesopotamia was Edward Pri ##ole ##au Warren .
As well as these senior architects , there was a team of Assistant Architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs . These architects were younger , and many of them had served in the war . The Assistant Architects were : George Ess ##el ##mont Gordon Le ##ith , Wilfred Clement von Berg , Charles Henry Holden ( who in 1920 became a Principal Architect ) , William Harrison Cow ##lish ##aw , William Bryce B ##inn ##ie , George Hartley Goldsmith , Frank Hig ##gin ##son , Arthur James Scott Hutton , Noel Ack ##royd Rew , and John Reginald Tru ##el ##ove . Other architects that worked for the Commission , or won competitions for the Commission memorials , included George Sal ##way Nicol , Harold Chal ##ton Bradshaw , Vern ##er Owen Re ##es , Gordon H . Holt , and Henry Philip Cart de Laf ##ont ##aine .
In January 1944 , Edward Mau ##fe was appointed Principal Architect for the UK . Mau ##fe worked extensively for the Commission for 25 years until 1969 , becoming Chief Architect and also succeeding Kenyon as Art ##istic Adv ##isor . Together with Mau ##fe , the other Principal Architects appointed during and after the Second World War were Hubert Worthington , Louis de So ##iss ##ons , Philip Hep ##worth and Colin St Clair O ##akes .
Leading sculpt ##ors that worked on the memorials and cemeteries after the First World War included Eric Henri Ken ##nington , Charles Thomas Wheeler , Gilbert Led ##ward , and Charles Sar ##ge ##ant Jagger . Other sculpt ##ors , both in the inter @ - @ war period and after the Second World War , included William Reid Dick , Ernest Gill ##ick , Basil G ##otto , Alfred Turner , Laurence A . Turner , Walter Gilbert , Henry Poole , Vernon Hill , Robert An ##ning Bell , Ferdinand Victor Bl ##und ##stone , Joseph Armitage , and Gilbert Bay ##es .
= = = Cemetery design = = =
= = = = Common architectural design features = = = =
Struct ##ural design has always played an important part in the Commission ' s cemeteries . Apart from a few exceptions , due to local geological conditions , the cemeteries follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world . This makes the cemeteries easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries .
A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought @ - @ iron gate entrance . For cemeteries in France and Belgium , a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments . All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials , a plan of the plots and rows , and a basic history of the cemetery . The register is located within a metal cup ##board that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery . More recently , in larger sites , a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign . The head ##stones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size .
The cemetery grounds are , except in drier climates , grass covered with a floral border around the head ##stones . There is also an absence of any paving between the head ##stone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace . However , Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and san ##it ##ises the nature of the war deaths .
= = = = Cross of Sacrifice and Stone of Remembrance = = = =
Typically , cemeteries of more than 40 graves contain a Cross of Sacrifice designed by architect Reginald Blom ##field . This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in church ##yards in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross . The cross is normally a fre ##est ##anding four @ - @ point limestone Latin cross , mounted on an octagonal base , and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet . A bronze long ##sw ##ord , blade down , is embedded on the face of the cross . This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery , intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self @ - @ sacrifice .
C ##emeteries with more than 1000 burials typically have a Stone of Remembrance , designed by Edwin L ##uty ##ens with the inscription " Their Name Liv ##eth for Ever ##more " . The concept of the Stone of Remembrance stone was developed by Rud ##yard Kip ##ling to commemorate those of all faith ##s and none respectively . In contrast to the Cross of Sacrifice , the design for the stone deliberately avoided " shapes associated with particular religions " . The geometry of the structure was based on studies of the Part ##hen ##on . Each stone is 3 @ . @ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) long and 1 @ . @ 5 metres ( 4 @ . @ 9 ft ) high . The shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarc ##ophagus and an altar . The feature was designed using the principle of ent ##asis . The subtle curves in the design , if extended , would form a sphere 1 @ , @ 80 ##1 feet 8 inches ( 54 ##9 @ . @ 15 m ) in diameter .
= = = = Head ##stones = = = =
Every grave is marked with a head ##stone . Each head ##stone contains the national emblem or regimental badge , rank , name , unit , date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives . The head ##stones use a standard upper case lettering designed by MacDonald Gill . Individual graves are arranged , where possible , in straight rows and marked by uniform head ##stones , the vast majority of which are made of Portland stone . The original head ##stone dimensions were 76 centimetres ( 30 in ) tall , 38 cm ( 15 in ) wide , and 7 @ . @ 6 cm ( 3 @ . @ 0 in ) thick .
Most head ##stones are inscribed with a cross , except for those deceased known to be atheist or non @ - @ Christian . In the case of burials of Victoria Cross or George Cross recipients , the regimental badge is supplemented by the Victoria Cross or George Cross emblem . Sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement ; in such cases their primary name is shown along with the notation " served as " . Many head ##stones are for unidentified casualties ; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body . The epit ##aph , developed by Rud ##yard Kip ##ling , that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is " A Soldier of the Great War known unto God " . Some head ##stones bear the text " believed to be buried in this cemetery " when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known . In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one head ##stone covers more than one grave . The head ##stone does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date , and even then only if it is known , and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death .
Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to dev ##iate from its standard design . In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes , such as Thailand and Turkey , stone @ - @ faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal head ##stones . These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sod ##den ground . In Italy head ##stones were carved from Chi ##amp ##o Per ##la limestone because it was in more plentiful supply . In Str ##uma Military Cemetery , in Greece , to avoid risk of earthquake damage , small head ##stones are laid flat on the ground . The smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia .
= = = = Hort ##iculture = = = =
Commission cemeteries are distinctive in treating fl ##oric ##ulture as an integral part of the cemetery design . Originally , the hort ##icultural concept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting , in contrast to traditionally bleak grave ##yards . Rec ##omm ##end ##ations given by Arthur William Hill , the Assistant Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew enabled the Commission to develop cemetery lay ##outs and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life . Comb ##ining structural and hort ##icultural elements was not unfamiliar to the Commission ' s architects . Sir Edwin L ##uty ##ens further ##ed his long @ - @ standing working relationship with hort ##ic ##ult ##ur ##ist Gertrude Je ##ky ##ll , whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants and roses greatly influenced the appearance of the cemeteries . Where possible , indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home .
Variety in texture , height and timing of floral display were equally important hort ##icultural considerations . The beds around each head ##stone are planted with a mixture of flor ##ib ##unda roses and herb ##aceous perennial ##s . Low @ - @ growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of head ##stones , ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from spl ##ashing back during rain . In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers , dwarf varieties of plants are used instead .
The absence of any form of paving between the head ##stone rows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs . Lawn paths add to the garden amb ##iance , and are ir ##rig ##ated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain . Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical , dry landscaping is an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission ' s hort ##ic ##ult ##ur ##ists , as is the case in Iraq . D ##rier areas require a different approach not only for lawn ##s , but also to plants and styles of planting . Similarly , there are separate hort ##icultural considerations in tropical climates . When many cemeteries are concentrated within a limited area , like along the Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula , mobile teams of garden ##ers operate from a local base . Elsewhere , larger cemeteries have their own dedicated staff while small cemeteries are usually tended by a single gardener working part @ - @ time .

Immediately following the First World War , the British Army remained responsible for the ex ##hum ##ation of remains . The Western Front was divided into sectors and comb ##ed for bodies by 12 @ - @ man ex ##hum ##ation units . Between the Armistice and September 1921 , the ex ##hum ##ation units reb ##ur ##ied 204 @ , @ 695 bodies . After 1921 , no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in February 1921 responsibility of the cemeteries was transferred to the Commission . Despite the rigorous searches , bodies continued to be discovered in numbers . In the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38 @ , @ 000 bodies were discovered . In the mid 1920s , 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly .
The discovery of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually . For example , in 2006 eight bodies of Canadian soldiers from the 78 ##th Battalion ( Winnipeg Gren ##adiers ) , CE ##F were discovered in a backyard in Hall ##u , France . In April 2013 , the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with metal detector in 2009 were re @ - @ interred at H . A . C . Cemetery near Ar ##ras , France . In March 2014 , the remains of 20 Commonwealth and 30 German soldiers were discovered in Vend ##in @ - @ le @ - @ Vie ##il , France with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reb ##ur ##ied at Lo ##os British Cemetery .
When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains . The details are then registered and archived at the Commission ' s headquarters . the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains , anthrop ##ological data and DNA . The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research . Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties . In December 2013 , it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick Corm ##ack , who was previously commemorated on the Ar ##ras Flying Services Memorial , had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in Mac ##hel ##en , East @ - @ Flanders in Belgium . Sergeant Leonard Maid ##ment was identified in 2013 after a visitor to Mar ##f ##aux British Cemetery discovered a head ##stone of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date .

C ##emeteries , including those of war dead , are targets for vandalism . The grav ##estones , cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception . The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the pursuits part ##aken by young people , noting the number of incidents increases when school ##children are on school holidays . Determ ##ined thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the Cross of Sacrifice , which are now replaced with identical ones made in fib ##reg ##lass .
The vandalism of Commission cemeteries has also been connected to the participation of Commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts . In the 1970s , in The Trou ##bles , Commission cemeteries in Ireland experienced vandalism . Vand ##als def ##aced the central memorial of the É ##tap ##les Military Cemetery in northern France with anti @ - @ British and anti @ - @ American graffiti on 20 March 2003 immediately after the beginning of the Iraq War . On 9 May 2004 , thirty @ - @ three head ##stones were demolished in the Gaza cemetery , which contains 3 @ , @ 69 ##1 graves , allegedly in retaliation for the Abu Gh ##ra ##ib prisoner abuse scandal .

The grammar is a rework ##ing of Don ##atus ' s Ars Minor with the addition of information drawn from other grammar ##ians . It was not designed for a newcomer to the Latin language , but is designed for more advanced students . It covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars , although not directly but through other grammatical works . There are also some examples drawn from the Ps ##al ##ms . The work was completed before he became archbishop , and was used not only in England but also on the continent .

= German Type UB I submarine =
The Type UB I was a class of small coastal submarines ( U @ - @ boats ) built in Germany at the beginning of the First World War . 20 boats were constructed , most of which went into service with the German Imperial Navy . Bo ##ats of this design were also operated by the Austro @ - @ Hungarian Navy ( Kaiserliche und König ##liche Kriegsmarine or K . u . K . Kriegsmarine ) and the Bulgarian Navy . The group is sometimes known as the UB @ - @ 1 class after SM UB @ - @ 1 , the class leader . In the Austro @ - @ Hungarian Navy , it was called the U @ - @ 10 class .
Built to meet the need for small maneuver ##able submarines able to operate in the narrow , shallow seas off Flanders , the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed , then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation . The design effort began in mid @ - @ August 1914 and by mid @ - @ October the first 15 boats were ordered from two German shipyards . The German Imperial Navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to Austria @ - @ Hungary , who ordered a further three boats in April 1915 . A total of 20 UB Is were built . Construction of the first boats for Germany began in early November 1914 ; all 20 were completed by October 1915 . Several of the first boats underwent trials in German home waters , but the rest were assembled and tested at either Antwerp or Pola . The German boats operated primarily in the Flanders , Baltic , and Constantinople Fl ##ot ##illas . The boats were about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) when surfaced and 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged . All had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes , and were equipped with a deck @ - @ mounted machine gun .
In 1918 four of the surviving German boats were converted into coastal minel ##ayers . Of the seventeen boats in German service , two were sold to Austria @ - @ Hungary , one was sold to Bulgaria , and nine were lost during the war . One of the five Austro @ - @ Hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired . The five surviving German boats , the four surviving Austro @ - @ Hungarian boats , and the Bulgarian boat were all turned over to the Allies after the end of the war and were broken up .
= = Design = =
In the earliest stages of the First World War the German Army ' s rapid advance along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . By 18 August 1914 , two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium , the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun .
The German Imperial Navy stipulated that the submarines must be transport ##able by rail , which imposed a maximum diameter of 3 @ . @ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) . The rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name " Project 34 " — resulted in the Type UB I design , created specifically for operation from Flanders . The boats were to be about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and to displace about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two bow torpedo tubes .
Bo ##ats of the Type UB I design were built by two manufacturers , Germania ##wer ##ft of Kiel and AG Weser of Bremen , which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards . The eight Germania ##wer ##ft @ - @ built boats were slightly longer at 28 @ . @ 10 metres ( 92 ft 2 in ) length overall , while the twelve Weser @ - @ built boats came in 22 centimetres ( 8 @ . @ 7 in ) shorter than their counterparts . All were 3 @ . @ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) ab ##eam and had a draft of 3 @ . @ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . The boats all displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) while surfaced , but differed slightly in displacement submerged . The slightly longer Germania ##wer ##ft boats displaced 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged , as they weighed 1 ton ##ne ( 0 @ . @ 98 long tons ) more than the Weser boats .
The dr ##ivet ##rain of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a D ##aim ##ler ( Germania ##wer ##ft ) or K ##ör ##ting ( Weser ) diesel engine on the surface , or a Siemens @ - @ Sch ##uck ##ert electric motor for underwater travel . The Weser boats were capable of nearly 7 @ . @ 5 knots ( 13 @ . @ 9 km / h ; 8 @ . @ 6 mph ) on the surface and a little more than 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @ . @ 9 mph ) submerged . The Germania ##wer ##ft boats were about 1 knot ( 1 @ . @ 9 km / h ; 1 @ . @ 2 mph ) slower than their Bremen @ - @ made counterparts . The boats were equipped with two 45 @ - @ centimet ##re ( 17 @ . @ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes . They were also armed with a single 8 @ - @ millimetre ( 0 @ . @ 31 in ) machine gun aff ##ixed to the deck .
= = Construction = =
The German Imperial Navy ordered its first fifteen Type UB I boats on 15 October 1914 . Eight boats — numbered UB @ - @ 1 to UB @ - @ 8 — were ordered from Germania ##wer ##ft of Kiel , and seven boats — numbered UB @ - @ 9 to U @ - @ 15 — from AG Weser of Bremen . After two of the class , UB @ - @ 1 and UB @ - @ 15 , were sold in February 1915 to ally Austria @ - @ Hungary ( becoming U @ - @ 10 and U @ - @ 11 in the Austro @ - @ Hungarian Navy ) , the German Imperial Navy ordered UB @ - @ 16 and UB @ - @ 17 from Weser . A further three for Austria @ - @ Hungary — U @ - @ 15 , U @ - @ 16 , and U @ - @ 17 — had been ordered from Weser by April , bringing the total number constructed to 20 .
UB @ - @ 1 and UB @ - @ 2 were laid down on 1 November 1914 at the Germania ##wer ##ft yard at Kiel . UB @ - @ 1 was launched on 22 January 1915 , just 75 working days later . UB @ - @ 2 ' s launch followed on 13 February . Among the Weser boats , UB @ - @ 9 was laid down first , on 6 November 1914 , and launched on 6 February 1915 , a week ahead of UB @ - @ 2 . These first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters , but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point .
The process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flat ##cars . Type UB I boats destined for service with the Flanders Flotilla made a five @ - @ day journey to Antwerp for the two - to three @ - @ week assembly process . After assembly at Antwerp the boats were towed by barge to Bru ##ges for trials . Bo ##ats selected for service in the Mediterranean were sent to the Austro @ - @ Hungarian port of Pola for assembly . The total time from departure of the rail ##cars from the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks .
By July 1915 all seventeen of the German Imperial Navy Type UB Is had been completed .
= = Service = =
During their trials the Type UB Is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being under ##powered ; one commander compared his Type UB I to a " sew ##ing machine " . According to authors R . H . Gibson and Maurice Pre ##nder ##g ##ast in their 1931 book The German Submarine War , 1914 – 1918 , the UB ##s did not have enough power to chase down steamers while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater , exhausting their batteries after little over an hour ' s running . In @ - @ service use revealed another problem : with a single propeller shaft / engine combination , if either component failed , the U @ - @ boat was almost totally disabled .
Another reported problem with the Type UB Is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes . The boats were equipped with compens ##ating tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the C / 06 torpedo ' s 1 @ , @ 700 @ - @ pound ( 770 kg ) weight , but this system did not always function properly ; as a result , when firing from per ##isc ##ope depth the boat could bro ##ach after firing or , if too much weight was taken on , pl ##unge to the depths . When UB @ - @ 15 torpedoed and sank Italian submarine Med ##usa in June 1915 , the tank failed to properly compensate , forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim im ##balance .
Despite the problems , the " tin tad ##poles " , as the Germans referred to them , were in active service from March 1915 through the end of the war , with half of the 20 boats lost during the war . Bo ##ats of the class served in three navies : the German Imperial Navy , the Austro @ - @ Hungarian Navy , and the Bulgarian Navy . In German service , they served primarily in the Flanders Flotilla , the Baltic Flotilla , and the Constantinople Flotilla .

The first Type UB I to enter service was UB @ - @ 10 , which formed the nucleus of the Flanders Flotilla , on 27 March 1915 . By the end of April five more Type UB I boats had become operational . UB @ - @ 10 was eventually joined in the Flanders Flotilla by UB @ - @ 2 , UB @ - @ 4 , UB @ - @ 5 , UB @ - @ 6 , UB @ - @ 12 , UB @ - @ 13 , UB @ - @ 16 , and UB @ - @ 17 ; of these , only UB @ - @ 2 made the journey to Flanders by sea rather than rail .
UB @ - @ 4 departed on the first patrol from Flanders on 9 April , and was responsible for sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla . The Type UB I boats of the Flanders Flotilla originally patrolled the area between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , but began patrolling the English Channel after UB @ - @ 6 pioneered a route past British antis ##ub ##marine nets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June .
Over the Type UB Is ' first year of service , UB @ - @ 4 and UB @ - @ 13 were both lost , and UB @ - @ 2 and UB @ - @ 5 were transferred to the Baltic Flotilla . In March 1917 , UB @ - @ 6 ran aground in Dutch waters and was interned for the rest of the war , along with her crew . The four remaining Type UB Is in Flanders — UB @ - @ 10 , UB @ - @ 12 , UB @ - @ 16 , UB @ - @ 17 — were all converted to minel ##ayers by 1918 , having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with ch ##utes to carry up to eight mines . All but UB @ - @ 10 were lost in 1918 ; UB @ - @ 10 , in poor repair and out of service , was scuttled in October 1918 when the Germans evacuated from Flanders .

UB @ - @ 3 disappeared en route to Constantinople in May 1915 , but the other three arrived there by mid @ - @ June .
The three Type UB I boats of the Constantinople Flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in the Black Sea . UB @ - @ 8 was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in May 1916 , and UB @ - @ 7 disappeared in the Black Sea in October 1916 , leaving UB @ - @ 14 as the sole remaining German Type UB I in the flotilla ; she was surrendered at Sevastopol in November 1918 to French armies stationed there during the Russian Civil War .

= Military history of Gibraltar during World War II =
The military history of Gibraltar during World War II exempl ##ifies Gibraltar ' s position as a British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy , both as a footh ##old on the continent of Europe , and as a bastion of British sea power . During World War II , Gibraltar served a vital role in both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean Theatre , controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean .
In addition to its commanding position , Gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean . Force H , under the command of Vice @ - @ Admiral James Somerville was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of Malta . During the course of the war , Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from Vichy French aircraft and from aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force ( Regia Aeron ##aut ##ica ) based on Sardinia . Additionally , the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy ( Regia Marina ) commando frog ##man unit ( Dec ##ima Fl ##ott ##ig ##lia MAS ) and their human torpedoes . This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship SS Ol ##ter ##ra in the nearby Spanish harbour of Alg ##ec ##iras . A number of attacks were also carried out by Spanish and Gibral ##t ##arian agents acting on behalf of the German Ab ##we ##hr .
Inside the Rock of Gibraltar itself , miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone . Mass ##es of rock were blast ##ed out to build an " underground city " . In huge man @ - @ made c ##aver ##ns , barracks , offices , and a fully equipped hospital were constructed , complete with an operating theatre and X @ - @ ray equipment .
Operation Torch , the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942 , was coordinated from the " Rock " . General Dwight D . Eisenhower , who was given command of the operation , set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation . Following the successful completion of the North African campaign and the surrender of Italy in 1943 , Gibraltar ' s role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear @ - @ area supply position . The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the Mediterranean until V @ - @ E Day in 1945 .
= = Prelude and evacuation = =
World War II dramatically changed the lives of Gibraltar ##ians . The decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltar ##ians ( some for up to ten years ) had nowhere to call ' home ' . Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being ' British ' by sharing in the war effort .
In early June 1940 , about 13 @ , @ 500 evacuees were shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco . However , following the capitulation of the French to the German armies later in June 1940 , the new Pro @ - @ German French Vichy Government found the presence of Gibral ##t ##arian evacuees in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal . The opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived under Commodore Cr ##ich ##ton , repatri ##ating 15 @ , @ 000 French servicemen who had been rescued from Dunkirk . Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked , the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the evacuees . Although Cr ##ich ##ton was unable to obtain permission to clean and rest ##ock his ships ( and contrary to British Admiralty orders which forbade the taking on of evacuees ) , when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dock ##yards , he opened up his gang ##ways for boarding . Just beforehand , the British fleet had destroyed a number of French warships at Mers el @ - @ K ##eb ##ir in order to prevent them ending up in German hands . The attack , during which 1 @ , @ 297 French sailors died , led to high tensions , which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by French troops to board taking only what they could carry , leaving many possessions behind . However , when they arrived at Gibraltar , the Governor would not allow them to land , fearing that once the evacuees were back on the Rock , it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time . Crow ##ds gathered in John Mackintosh Square in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke , speeches were made and two City Councill ##ors accompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor ( Sir Clive Liddell ) to ask that the evacuees be allowed to land . After receiving instructions from London , a landing was allowed as long as the evacuees returned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock , and by 13 July the re @ - @ evacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed .
British conservative politician Oliver Stanley agreed to accept the evacuees in the United Kingdom , but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved . The Governor , he declared , had given the number of evacuees first as 13 @ , @ 000 , then as 14 @ , @ 000 and finally as 16 @ , @ 000 . He asked for the situation to be clarified , stress ##ing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13 @ , @ 000 could be accepted , 2 @ , @ 000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira . The situation , replied General Liddell on 19 July , " is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22 @ , @ 000 . The 13 @ , @ 000 was the number sent to Morocco , and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered . " In London the evacuees were placed in the hands of the Ministry of Health , and many were housed in Kensington area . Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified , coupled with the arrival of har ##rowing letters , describing the circumstances in which the evacuees were living .
In September rumours were already circulating among the evacuees , and in Gibraltar , that the possibility of re @ - @ evacuating the Gibraltar ##ians once more was being moot ##ed , this time the destination being Jamaica , in the West Indies . After much contention , it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island , and 1 @ , @ 09 ##3 evacuees left for Jamaica direct , on 9 October , with more following later on . However petitions followed and the demands were met , partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping . The situation at the end of 1940 , therefore , was that approximately 2 @ , @ 000 evacuees were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira , with the bulk of around 10 @ , @ 000 housed in the London area .
= = Royal Air Force involvement : 1939 – 1941 = =
Construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1 @ , @ 550 yards ( 1 @ , @ 417 m ) . The land rec ##lamation commenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an RAF camp at the " North Front " , now RAF Gibraltar . The RAF dispatched their next squadron to Gibraltar at this time and it was in September 1939 that war with Germany was declared and the strong possibility of German submarines concentrating in the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish port facilities , loom ##ed large in Admiralty thinking . So at 09 : 00 ( UTC ) on the 9 September 1939 , No . 202 Squadron RAF was ordered to Gibraltar , loaded to the gun ##w ##ales with equipment .
On 25 September 1939 , No 200 ( Coastal ) Group was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of No 202 S ##q ##n . The Group ' s function was the control of Royal Air Force units operating from Gibraltar . In late 1940 the Group was transferred to Coastal Command . Later a combined HQ was formed which commenced operations in early 1942 .

On 18 July 1940 , after the attack on the French Fleet at Mers @ - @ el @ - @ K ##é ##bir by the British , the Vichy government authorized a bombing raid of Gibraltar as a response . Little damage was reported to have been done .
On Tuesday , 24 September , the Italian Stefani news agency reported : " As a repr ##isal for the bombardment of Dak ##ar y ##esterday morning , one @ - @ hundred @ - @ and @ - @ twenty French aircraft based in Morocco attacked Gibraltar . " On the same day , the United Press Agency reported : " The French government has issued an official denial of reports , according to which French aircraft were said to have attacked Gibraltar . Up until now , no repr ##is ##als have been undertaken . " But the United Press report ended on an ominous note with : " French repr ##is ##als are imminent . "
Again , on the same day , the Vichy French government issued orders for the naval base and city of Gibraltar to be bombarded . As a result , six bomber squadrons of the Vichy French Air Force ( Arm ##ée de l ' Air de Vichy ) and four squadrons of the Vichy French Navy ( Marine national ##e de Vichy ) were employed in the operation . The 64 bombers flew from bases in Or ##an , T ##af ##ar ##ou ##i ( in Algeria ) , Mek ##nes , Med ##i ##oun ##a , and Port Ly ##aut ##ey ( in Morocco ) . The French action was approved by both the German Armistice Commission and the Italian Armistice Commission .
No British aircraft were encountered and much damage was done in the area south of the fortress . The South M ##ole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged . In the northern part of Gibraltar , fires broke out .
On 25 September , the French returned with a larger force of eighty @ - @ three bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations . Again , aircraft of the British Royal Air Force made no appearance . However , the French crews did report encountering heavy anti @ - @ aircraft fire .

The air attack on 25 September was the last by Vichy forces on Gibraltar .
= = Operation Felix : 1940 – 1941 = =
The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but , given its strategic importance , Germany made plans to capture Gibraltar . Cod ##en ##amed " Felix " , the plan which was signed by Adolf Hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command . With or without permission , Germany would take entry through Spain and attack Gibraltar driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean . The Strait would be effectively closed to the Allies once Gibraltar was in German hands , forcing Asia @ - @ bound Allied shipping to steam all the way around Africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal . The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterward at Spanish air bases . To deny a possible Spanish capture of the base , the German planners decided that the final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone .
Dipl ##omatic failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the Wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940 .
General Ludwig K ##ü ##b ##ler ' s XL ##I ##X Corps would conduct the actual attack on the Rock . The assault forces would comprise the Infantry Regiment Gro ##ß ##de ##utsch ##land , the 98 ##th Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division , 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions , three observation battalions , three engineer battalions , two smoke battalions , a detachment of 150 Brandenburg ##ers , and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles ( Goli ##aths ) , packed with high explosives .
As part of a combined @ - @ force operation , the German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) would contribute Ju 88 ##As , St ##uk ##as , Messersch ##mit ##ts , three light AA battalions , and three heavy AA battalions . Nazi Germany ' s Kriegsmarine would cooperate by using U @ - @ boats to interfere with British naval movement and empl ##acing coastal batteries to further discourage the Royal Navy .
On 10 March 1941 , with Operation Barbarossa loom ##ing , Felix was amended to Operation Felix @ - @ Heinrich , whereby German troops would be withdrawn from the USSR to capture Gibraltar . As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco ' s intr ##ans ##ig ##ence , the operation was postponed , modified , and ultimately abandoned .
= = Italian bombing of Gibraltar = =
From Sardinia , Italian Pi ##aggio P . 108 bombers attacked Gibraltar several times , mainly in 1942 . The last raids on Gibraltar were done during the 1943 Allied landing in Algeria , when those bombers hit successfully even the Or ##an port .
The only unit of the Regia Aeron ##aut ##ica ( Royal Air Force ) ever to fly the Pi ##aggio P . 108 was the " 274 ##th Long @ - @ Range Bombardment Squadron " . This unit was formed in May 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines . The training of the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only in June 1942 the 274 ##th became operational . The most spectacular raids with the P . 108 bombers were flown in October 1942 when several night attacks against Gibraltar were undertaken from Sardinia .
After the armistice of Cass ##ib ##ile ( 8 September ) , the German @ - @ allied Italian Social Republic launched at least two raids on Gibraltar : one on the night of 4 – 5 June 1944 with ten SM . 79 ##bis aircraft and another on 6 June with nine aircraft . Both sorties were undertaken by the G ##rupp ##o Aer ##os ##il ##ur ##anti " Bus ##c ##ag ##lia – F ##agg ##ion ##i " .

Known as the " Flo ##ating Trojan Horse of Gibraltar " , Dec ##ima Fl ##ott ##ig ##lia MAS , an Italian commando frog ##man unit created during the Fasc ##ist government , engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at Gibraltar .
Gibraltar was a very tempt ##ing target for the Italians , who saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping . The Italian frog ##men originally used a Spanish villa ( Villa Carm ##ela ) located two miles ( 3 km ) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Con ##ch ##ita Ram ##ogn ##ino . Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Ol ##ter ##ra , interned in Alg ##ec ##iras .
= = Ab ##we ##hr sab ##ote ##urs from Spain = =
Lesser known than the Italian actions were the sabotage operations and lim ##pet @ - @ mine attacks carried out by Spanish and Gibral ##t ##arian agents recruited in the Camp ##o de Gibraltar by the Germans . The Ab ##we ##hr contacted a Spanish staff officer from Camp ##o de Gibraltar , Lieutenant Colonel Ele ##uter ##io Sánchez Rub ##io , a Spanish officer , member of the Fal ##ange and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the Camp ##o , to establish a network of sab ##ote ##urs with access to Gibraltar . Sánchez Rub ##io designated Emilio Pl ##azas Tej ##era , also a member of Fal ##ange , as operations chief of the organisation . Most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were Spaniards from the Camp ##o . A combination of financial reward , ideological commitment and some threats and intimidation were used to gather a significant number of agents . According to the British intelligence , there were at least 183 Spaniards and Gibraltar ##ians involved in the espionage and sabotage operations against Gibraltar .
Sab ##ot ##age operations were ordered from Berlin in the late autumn of 1940 , but actual work did not start until early 1941 . The first operations were unsuccessful . A first attempt to smugg ##le a bomb into Gibraltar was aborted , as the timing device was faulty . In February there was a large explosion in the North Tunnel , and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield . In June 1941 , however , the British intelligence fo ##iled a new attempt , by a German agent , to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship . Another attempt failed when Pl ##azas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive . It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed . In January 1942 , two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip .
Fin ##anced , trained and equipped by the Germans , the sab ##ote ##urs sank the armed traw ##ler HM ##T Erin , and destroyed the auxiliary minesw ##eeper HM ##T Hon ##ju , which resulted in the deaths of six British seamen on 18 January 1942 . Pl ##azas was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of Pu ##ente Mayor ##ga , Manuel Romero Hume , who allowed him to beach a row ##boat there . The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations . In March 1942 , a Gibral ##t ##arian , José Key , one of the most prominent agents working for the Germans , responsible for the collection of information on military movements for the Ab ##we ##hr was arrested and executed in W ##ands ##worth Prison in late 1942 . By September 1942 , Pl ##azas , whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time , resigned and left Carlos Cal ##vo , his second in command , in charge of the operations . In late 1942 , the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded . In early 1943 , the arrival of an experienced head of Ab ##we ##hr operations in Spain improved the outreach of the operations .
In March 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by Cal ##vo ' s agents . The British , growing suspicious of some of the sab ##ote ##urs , banned them from entering Gibraltar . This forced the Ab ##we ##hr to ask Cal ##vo for new personnel . A Spani ##ard working on the Rock , José Martín Muñoz , was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank at Co ##aling Island on 30 June 1943 ; this mission , however , would be the first and the last for Muñoz , because he was corn ##ered and arrested by British authorities in August , when he tried to smugg ##le a bomb into a weapons magazine inside Rag ##ged Staff Cave . After being sentenced to death , he was hanged on 11 January 1944 in Gibraltar by British execution ##er Albert Pierre ##point . A member of an unrelated Ab ##we ##hr sabotage network , Luis López Cord ##ón @ - @ Cu ##enc ##a ( also arrested in 1943 ) was executed by Pierre ##point on the same day . Cal ##vo himself was put under arrest by the Spanish police and neutral ##ized . He would be a free man again in December , when he rejoined the Ab ##we ##hr in Madrid , under direct orders of Wolfgang Bl ##a ##um , aka Baum ##ann , head of the sabotage section in Spain . After a Fal ##ang ##ist attempt against the life of pro @ - @ allied General José Enrique Var ##ela , perpet ##rated by Sánchez Rub ##io network ' s agent Juan José Dom ##í ##ng ##uez and a meeting between Anthony Eden and the Spanish ambassador at London , Jacob ##o Fitz @ - @ James Stuart , Ab ##we ##hr activities around Gibraltar came to an end .
= = Operation Tr ##acer : 1941 – 1942 = =
Operation Tr ##acer was a top @ - @ secret British stay @ - @ behind sp ##ying mission that was only to be implemented if Gibraltar was captured by the Axis Powers . Six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year . The volunteers — two doctors , three signal ##men and their leader — would run an observation post with one 12 @ - @ inch ( 300 mm ) by 6 @ - @ inch ( 150 mm ) slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the Mediterranean . The team would then wire back all shipping movements to the British Admiralty .
They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be emb ##al ##med and cemented into the brick floor . Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released .
As the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941 , an idea for a series of secret observation posts ( first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden ) was put together under Operation Tr ##acer .
Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffrey Bir ##ley and his chief engineer Colonel Ford ##ham . The site chosen at Lord A ##ire ##y ' s Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tun ##n ##elling scheme for a shelter . Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard Gamb ##ier @ - @ Parry . Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task . A member of Scott ’ s ill @ - @ fated expedition to the Antarctic , George Murray Lev ##ick was called up as Sur ##geon @ - @ Commander to advise on survival techniques . There were practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and clothing to consider as well as vital " psychology of the personnel " . The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their c ##avern fully equipped and ready for occupation . A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret look ##out posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars . However , Operation Tr ##acer was never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front .
The operation had been cloud ##ed in mystery until the discovery of papers at the Public Record Office in Kew UK . Previously in the 1960s , details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as " Operation Monkey " , yet facts were very sparse .
In 1997 " Stay Behind Cave " ( as it was nicknamed ) was discovered in Gibraltar by the Gibraltar C ##aving Group , but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission . The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel . Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years .
In November 2006 Jim Cr ##one and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson , senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , met possibly the only member of Operation Tr ##acer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr . W . A . Bruce Cooper at his home in England . Cooper , 92 at the time , provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a Sur ##geon @ - @ Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve ( RN ##VR ) . He recalled stories about his colleagues , his training , and his feelings about the task .

Many of these U @ - @ boats were themselves attacked negotiating the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by Britain . Nine U @ - @ boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged .
= = North African Campaign : 1942 = =
Plans for the Allied counter offensive after the attack on Pearl Harbor were ongoing by mid @ - @ 1942 . An invasion of Europe in 1943 would be un ##work ##able , but the allies could attack the " soft under ##belly of Europe " through the Mediterranean , as Prime Minister Winston Churchill put it . Dev ##ised by President Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill and code named Operation Torch , the plan was to occupy French North Africa : Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia . From these French colonies , attacks could be launched that would drive Italy out of the war .
In July 1942 , Lieutenant General Dwight D . Eisenhower was appointed Allied Commander @ - @ in @ - @ Chief of Operation Torch . Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this , the first large @ - @ scale Anglo @ - @ American operation of the war . He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take over , not just command of Operation Torch itself , but also military command of Gibraltar .
General Eisenhower stayed at The Conv ##ent , the official Governor ' s residence , but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the Rock . In his memoirs General Eisenhower wrote :
The subterranean passages under the Rock provided the sole available office space , and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces . The eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by fee ##ble electric bulbs . D ##amp , cold air in block @ - @ long passages was heavy with stagn ##ation and did not noticeably respond to the cl ##attering efforts of electric fans . Through the arched ceilings came a constant d ##rip , d ##rip , d ##rip of surface water that faith ##fully but dre ##arily tick ##ed off the seconds of the inter ##min ##able , almost un ##end ##urable , wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins .
One hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports conver ##ged on Gibraltar . More than 400 aircraft of all types were cr ##am ##med into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway . Fighters had been shipped in cr ##ates and assembled on the airfield . Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition , fuel , and other essential supplies . 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF mess ##es at North Front .
On 8 November 1942 , 46 ##6 aircraft from Gibraltar landed on captured North African airfields .
From their headquarters in Gibraltar , General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham directed Operation Torch , the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces .
= = = War tunnels = = =
Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it , the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar . This " town " inside the Rock contained its own power station , water supply , and hospital . Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end . Two Canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with diamond @ - @ tipped drills and 5 British engineer companies , added some 30 miles ( 48 km ) of such tunnels , a feat thought impossible at the time . That was enough to hold all 30 @ , @ 000 troops on the rock . Today , the rock has more underground tunnels than roads .

In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of Sik ##orski ' s Liber ##ator II AL ##5 ##23 , but was unable to determine the probable cause , finding only that it was an accident and the " aircraft became uncont ##roll ##able for reasons which cannot be established " . A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to jamming aircraft controls . Despite this finding , the political context of the event , coupled with a variety of curious circumstances , immediately gave rise to speculation that Sik ##orski ' s death had been no accident , and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet , British or even Polish conspiracy .

The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the evacuees to the Rock .

Military history of the British Commonwealth in the Second World War
= N ##erva =
N ##erva ( Latin : Marcus Coc ##ce ##ius N ##erva Caesar Augustus ; 8 November , 30 AD – 27 January , 98 AD ) was Roman Emperor from 96 to 98 . N ##erva became Emperor at the age of sixty @ - @ five , after a lifetime of imperial service under Nero and the rulers of the Fl ##avian dynasty . Under Nero , he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the P ##ison ##ian conspiracy of 65 . Later , as a loyalist to the Fl ##av ##ians , he attained consul ##ships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of Vespasian and Domitian respectively .
On 18 September 96 , Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the Pra ##et ##orian Guard and several of his freed ##men . On the same day , N ##erva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate . This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor . As the new ruler of the Roman Empire , he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the aut ##ocratic government of Domitian .
N ##erva ' s brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army . A revolt by the Pra ##et ##orian Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir . After some deliber ##ation N ##erva adopted Tra ##jan , a young and popular general , as his successor . After barely fifteen months in office , N ##erva died of natural causes on 27 January 98 . Upon his death he was succeeded and de ##ified by Tra ##jan .
Although much of his life remains obscure , N ##erva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians . N ##erva ' s greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death , thus founding the N ##erva – Anton ##ine dynasty .
= = Early career = =
= = = Family = = =
Marcus Coc ##ce ##ius N ##erva was born in the village of N ##arn ##i , 50 kilometers north of Rome , to the family of Marcus Coc ##ce ##ius N ##erva , Suff ##ect Consul in 40 , and Ser ##g ##ia Pl ##aut ##illa . Ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35 . He had at least one attested sister , named Coc ##ce ##ia , who married Lucius Salv ##ius Tit ##ianus Oth ##o , the brother of the future Emperor Oth ##o .
Like Vespasian , the founder of the Fl ##avian dynasty , N ##erva was a member of the Italian nobility rather than one of the elite of Rome . Nevertheless , the Coc ##ce ##ii were among the most este ##emed and prominent political families of the late Republic and early Empire , attaining consul ##ships in each successive generation . The direct ancestors of N ##erva on his father ' s side , all named Marcus Coc ##ce ##ius N ##erva , were associated with imperial circles since the time of Emperor Augustus ( 27 BC – AD 14 ) .
His great @ - @ grandfather was Consul in 36 BC ( in replacement , and abdicated ) , and Governor of Asia in the same year . His grandfather became Consul Suff ##ect in July of either 21 or 22 , and was known as a personal friend of Emperor Tiberius ( AD 14 – 37 ) , accompanying the emperor during his voluntary sec ##lusion on Cap ##ri from 23 onwards , dying in 33 . N ##erva ' s father , finally , attained the consul ##ship in 40 under emperor Caligula ( 37 – 41 ) . The Coc ##ce ##ii were connected with the Julio @ - @ Claud ##ian dynasty through the marriage of Ser ##g ##ia Pl ##aut ##illa ' s brother Oct ##avius La ##enas , and Rub ##ell ##ia Bass ##a , the great @ - @ granddaughter of Tiberius .
= = = Imperial service = = =
Not much of N ##erva ' s early life or career is recorded , but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career . He was pra ##et ##or @ - @ elect in the year 65 and , like his ancestors , moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strateg ##ist . As an advisor to Emperor Nero , he successfully helped detect and expose the P ##ison ##ian conspiracy of 65 . Ex ##act ##ly what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable , since they earned him rewards equal to those of Nero ' s guard prefect Tig ##ell ##inus . He received triumph ##al honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace .
According to the contemporary poet Mart ##ial , Nero also held N ##erva ' s literary abilities in high esteem , h ##ailing him as the " Tib ##ull ##us of our time " . Another prominent member of Nero ' s entourage was Vespasian , an old and respected general who had celebrated military triumph ##s during the 4 ##0s . It appears Vespasian befriended N ##erva during his time as an imperial advisor , and may have asked him to watch over Vespasian ' s youngest son Domitian when Vespasian departed for the Jewish war in 67 .
The suicide of Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio @ - @ Claud ##ian dynasty to an end , leading to the chaotic Year of the Four Em ##perors , which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors Gal ##ba , Oth ##o and Vit ##ell ##ius , until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69 . Virt ##ually nothing is known of N ##erva ' s whereabouts during 69 , but despite the fact that Oth ##o was his brother @ - @ in @ - @ law , he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the Fl ##av ##ians .
For services unknown , he was rewarded with a consul ##ship early in Vespasian ' s reign in 71 . This was a remarkable honour , not only because he held this office early under the new regime , but also because it was an ordinary consul ##ship ( instead of a less prestigious suff ##ect consul ##ship ) , making him one of the few non @ - @ Fl ##av ##ians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian . After 71 N ##erva again disappears from historical record , presumably continuing his career as an incons ##p ##ic ##uous advisor under Vespasian ( 69 – 79 ) and his sons Titus ( 79 – 81 ) and Domitian ( 81 – 96 ) .
He re @ - @ emerges during the revolt of Saturn ##inus in 89 . On 1 January , 89 , the governor of Germania Superior , Lucius Anton ##ius Saturn ##inus , and his two legions at Mainz , Leg ##io XIV Gem ##ina and Leg ##io XXI Rap ##ax , revolted against the Roman Empire with the aid of a tribe of the Chatt ##i . The governor of Germania Infer ##ior , L ##app ##ius Maximus , moved to the region at once , assisted by the proc ##ur ##ator of R ##ha ##et ##ia , Titus Fl ##avius Nor ##ban ##us . Within twenty @ - @ four days the rebellion was crushed , and its leaders at Mainz sav ##ag ##ely punished . The mut ##inous legions were sent to the front of Illy ##ric ##um , while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded .
Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consul ##ship with N ##erva . Again , the honour suggested N ##erva had played a part in unc ##overing the conspiracy , perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the P ##ison ##ian conspiracy under Nero . Alternatively , Domitian may have selected N ##erva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status @ - @ quo of the regime . The revolt had been suppressed , and the Empire could return to order .

= = = Access ##ion = = =
On 18 September , 96 , Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials . The Fast ##i Ost ##i ##enses , the Ost ##ian Cal ##endar , records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus Coc ##ce ##ius N ##erva emperor . Despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice . N ##erva was old and childless , and had spent much of his career out of the public light , prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian ' s assassination .
According to Cass ##ius Dio , the conspirators approached N ##erva as a potential successor prior to the assassination , which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot . Su ##eton ##ius by contrast does not mention N ##erva , but he may have omitted his role out of tact ##fulness . Considering the works of Su ##eton ##ius were published under N ##erva ' s direct descendants Tra ##jan and Had ##rian , it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder . On the other hand , N ##erva lacked widespread support in the Empire , and as a known Fl ##avian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators . The precise facts have been obscured by history , but modern historians believe N ##erva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , within hours after the news of the assassination broke .
Although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health , N ##erva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless . Furthermore , he had close connections with the Fl ##avian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate . N ##erva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero ; he knew that to hes ##itate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict . Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts , he accepted . The decision may have been h ##asty so as to avoid civil war , but neither the Senate nor N ##erva appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against Domitian .
Following the accession of N ##erva as emperor , the Senate passed damn ##atio memor ##iae on Domitian : his coins and statues were melted , his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records . In many instances , existing portraits of Domitian , such as those found on the Canc ##eller ##ia Relief ##s , were simply rec ##ar ##ved to fit the likeness of N ##erva . This allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material . In addition , the vast palace which Domitian had erected on the Pal ##atine Hill , known as the Fl ##avian Palace , was renamed the " House of the People " , and N ##erva himself took up residence in Vespasian ' s former villa in the Gardens of Sall ##ust .
= = = Administration = = =
The change of government was welcome particularly to the senators , who had been harshly persecuted during Domitian ' s reign . As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters , N ##erva publicly swore that no senators would be put to death as long as he remained in office . He called an end to trials based on treason , released those who had been imprisoned under these charges , and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled .
All properties which had been confiscated by Domitian were returned to their respective families . N ##erva also sought to involve the Senate in his government , but this was not entirely successful . He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted , and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @ - @ Domitian ##ic faction of the Senate , he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life .
Having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , N ##erva had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace . As was custom by this time , a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army . Accordingly , a cong ##iar ##ium of 75 den ##arii per head was bestowed upon the citizens , while the soldiers of the Pra ##et ##orian Guard received a don ##at ##iv ##um which may have amounted to as much as 5000 den ##arii per person . This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most need ##y Romans .
To the poorest , N ##erva granted allot ##ments of land worth up to 60 million s ##ester ##ces . He exem ##pted parents and their children from a 5 % inheritance tax , and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5 % to their municipality to support the children of need ##y families ; al ##imentary schemes which were later expanded by Tra ##jan , Anton ##inus Pius , and Marcus Aurel ##ius . Furthermore , numerous taxes were rem ##itted and privileges granted to Roman provinces . Nam ##ely , he probably abolished the F ##iscus I ##uda ##icus , the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay : some of his coins bear the legend FI ##SC ##I I ##U ##DA ##IC ##I C ##AL ##U ##M ##N ##IA SU ##BL ##ATA ( abolition of mal ##icious prosecution regarding the Jewish tax ) .
Before long , N ##erva ' s expenses strained the economy of Rome and , although perhaps not ruin ##ous to the extent once suggested by Syme , necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce expenditures . The most super ##fl ##uous religious sacrifices , games and horse races were abolished , while new income was generated from Domitian ' s former possessions , including the auction ##ing of ships , estates , and even furniture . Large amounts of money were obtained from Domitian ' s silver and gold statues , and N ##erva forbade that similar images be made in his honor .
Because he reigned only briefly , N ##erva ' s public works were few , instead completing projects which had been initiated under Fl ##avian rule . This included extensive repairs to the Roman road system and the expansion of the aqu ##ed ##ucts . The latter program was headed by the former consul S ##ext ##us Julius Front ##inus , who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on Rome ' s water supply , De Aqu ##is Ur ##bis Rom ##ae . The only major landmarks constructed under N ##erva were a gran ##ary , known as the Hor ##rea N ##erv ##ae , and a small Imperial Forum begun by Domitian , which linked the Forum of Augustus to the Temple of Peace . Little remains , partly because the Via de ##i For ##i Imperial ##i cuts across it .
= = = Crisis of succession = = =
Despite N ##erva ' s measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people , support for Domitian remained strong in the army , which had called for his de ##ification immediately after the assassination . In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the Pra ##et ##orian Guard , N ##erva had dismissed their prefect Titus Pet ##ron ##ius Sec ##und ##us — one of the chief conspirators against Domitian — and replaced him with a former commander , Cas ##per ##ius A ##el ##ianus .
Likewise , the generous don ##at ##iv ##um bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change . The Pra ##et ##or ##ians considered these measures insufficient , however , and demanded the execution of Domitian ' s assassins , which N ##erva refused . Contin ##ued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the grav ##est crisis of N ##erva ' s reign .
While the swift transfer of power following Domitian ' s death had prevented a civil war from erupt ##ing , N ##erva ' s position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable , and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority . Upon his accession , he had ordered a halt to treason trials , but at the same time allowed the prosecution of inform ##ers by the Senate to continue . This measure led to chaos , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies , leading the consul Fr ##onto to famously remark that Domitian ' s tyr ##anny was ultimately prefer ##able to N ##erva ' s anarchy . Early in 97 , a conspiracy led by the senator Gaius Cal ##p ##urn ##ius P ##iso Crass ##us F ##rug ##i Lic ##inian ##us failed , but once again N ##erva refused to put the conspirators to death , much to the disapproval of the Senate .
The situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor , made more pressing because of N ##erva ' s old age and sickness . He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives , who were unsu ##ited for political office . A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that , by 97 , N ##erva was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius N ##igr ##inus Cur ##iat ##ius M ##atern ##us , the powerful governor of Syria . This was covert ##ly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus Ul ##p ##ius Tra ##ianus , commonly known as Tra ##jan , a general of the armies at the German frontier .
In October 97 these tensions came to a head when the Pra ##et ##orian Guard , led by Cas ##per ##ius A ##el ##ianus , laid siege to the Imperial Palace and took N ##erva hostage . He was forced to submit to their demands , agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian ' s death and even giving a speech than ##king the rebellious Pra ##et ##or ##ians . Titus Pet ##ron ##ius Sec ##und ##us and Part ##hen ##ius , Domitian ' s former chamber ##lain , were sought out and killed . N ##erva was unharmed in this assault , but his authority was damaged beyond repair .
He realized that his position was no longer ten ##able without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people . Shortly thereafter , he announced the adoption of Tra ##jan as his successor , and with this decision all but abdicated . Tra ##jan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the consul ##ship with N ##erva in 98 :
Contrary to the view here popularized by Cass ##ius Dio , however , N ##erva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor . Faced with a major crisis , he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation . The only candidate with sufficient military experience , cons ##ular ancestry , and connections was Tra ##jan . Likewise , Edward Gib ##bon ' s assertion that N ##erva here ##by established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Em ##perors has found little support among modern historians .
= = Death and legacy = =
On 1 January , 98 , at the start of his fourth consul ##ship , N ##erva suffered a stroke during a private audience . Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of Sall ##ust , on 28 January . He was de ##ified by the Senate , and his ashes were laid to rest in the M ##ausoleum of Augustus .
N ##erva was succeeded without incident by his adopted son Tra ##jan , who was greeted by the Roman populace with much enthusiasm . According to Pliny the Younger , Tra ##jan dedicated a temple in honour of N ##erva , yet no trace of it has ever been found ; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the De ##ified N ##erva issued until ten years after his death . According to Cass ##ius Dio , however , the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against N ##erva , Cas ##per ##ius A ##el ##ianus , was ' dismissed ' upon Tra ##jan ' s accession .
Due to the lack of written sources on this period , much of N ##erva ' s life has remained obscure . The most substantial surviving account of the reign of N ##erva was written by the 3rd @ - @ century historian Cass ##ius Dio . His Roman History , which spans nearly a millennium , from the arrival of A ##en ##eas in Italy until the year 229 , was composed more than one hundred years after N ##erva had died . Further details are added by an abrid ##ged biography from the Ep ##it ##ome de Caesar ##ibus , a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th @ - @ century historian Aurel ##ius Victor .
A more comprehensive text , presumed to describe the life of N ##erva in closer detail , is the Hist ##ories , by the contemporary historian Tac ##itus . The Hist ##ories is an account of the history of Rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperor Nero in 69 until the death of Domitian in 96 . Unfortunately , a substantial part of the work has been lost , with only the first five books covering the Year of the Four Em ##perors remaining . In the introduction to his biography of G ##naeus Julius Ag ##ric ##ola however , Tac ##itus speaks highly of N ##erva , describing his reign as " the dawn of a most happy age , [ when ] N ##erva Caesar blended things once irre ##con ##cil ##able , sovereignty and freedom " .
The surviving histories speak equally positively of N ##erva ' s brief reign , although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies . Both Cass ##ius Dio and Aurel ##ius Victor emphasize his wisdom and moder ##ation , with Dio comm ##ending his decision to adopt Tra ##jan as his heir . These views were later popularized by the 18th @ - @ century historian Edward Gib ##bon in his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . Gib ##bon considered N ##erva the first of the Five Good Em ##perors , five successive rulers under whom the Roman Empire " was governed by absolute power , under the guidance of wisdom and virtue " from 96 until 180 . Nevertheless , even Gib ##bon notes that , compared to his successors , N ##erva may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign :
Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment , character ##izing N ##erva as a well @ - @ intention ##ed but weak and ineff ##ectual ruler . The Roman Senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule , but N ##erva ' s misman ##agement of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a significant crisis . The mutiny led by Cas ##per ##ius A ##el ##ianus was never intended as a coup , but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor . The adoption of Tra ##jan expanded his power base with a respected , reliable general as his successor . Mur ##ison concludes that N ##erva ' s real talents were in fact ill @ - @ suited to the em ##per ##orship :
His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary , if tumultuous stop @ - @ gap before the Tra ##jan ##ic @ - @ Anton ##ine dynasties . It is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign , the Forum of N ##erva , ultimately became known as the Forum Trans ##itorium , or transitional forum .
Two modern statues which commemorate N ##erva can be found in towns associated with him . There is an equestrian statue in Gloucester , England , a town which was founded in his honour . It is at the entrance to South ##gate Street . There is also a statue at his alleged birthplace , N ##arn ##i in Italy , at Coc ##ce ##io N ##erva street .

The Hust ##ler is a 1961 American drama film directed by Robert Ross ##en from Walter T ##ev ##is ' s 1959 novel of the same name , adapted for the screen by Ross ##en and Sidney Carroll . It tells the story of small @ - @ time pool hust ##ler " Fast Eddie " Fel ##son and his desire to break into the " major league " of professional hust ##ling and high @ - @ stakes w ##ag ##ering by high @ - @ roll ##ers that follows it . He throws his raw talent and ambition up against the best player in the country ; seeking to best the legendary pool player " Minnesota F ##ats . " After initially losing to F ##ats and getting involved with unsc ##rup ##ulous manager Bert Gordon , Eddie returns to try again , but only after paying a terrible personal price .
The film was shot on location in New York City . It stars Paul Newman as " Fast " Eddie Fel ##son , Jackie Gle ##ason as Minnesota F ##ats , Piper Laurie as Sarah , and George C . Scott as Bert .
The Hust ##ler was a major critical and popular success , gaining a reputation as a modern classic . Its exploration of winning , losing , and character garnered a number of major awards ; it is also credited with helping to spark a resurgence in the popularity of pool . Real @ - @ life pool player Rudolf Wander ##one , known at the time as " New York F ##ats " and " Chicago F ##ats " , claimed to be the real life inspiration for Gle ##ason ' s character , Minnesota F ##ats , and adopted the name as his own .
= = Plot = =
Small @ - @ time pool hust ##ler " Fast Eddie " Fel ##son travels cross @ - @ country with his partner Charlie to challenge the legendary player " Minnesota F ##ats " . Arriving at F ##ats ' home pool hall , Eddie declares he will win $ 10 @ , @ 000 that night . F ##ats arrives and he and Eddie agree to play straight pool for $ 200 a game . After initially falling behind , Eddie sur ##ges back to being $ 1 @ , @ 000 ahead and suggests raising the bet to $ 1 @ , @ 000 a game ; F ##ats agrees . He sends out a runner , Pre ##acher , to Johnny ' s Bar , ostensibly for wh ##iskey , but really to get professional gamb ##ler Bert Gordon to the hall . Eddie gets ahead $ 11 @ , @ 000 and Charlie tries to convince him to quit , but Eddie insists the game will end only when F ##ats says it is over . F ##ats agrees to continue after Bert labels Eddie a " loser . " After 25 hours and an entire bottle of b ##our ##bon , Eddie is ahead over $ 18 @ , @ 000 , but loses it all along with all but $ 200 of his original stake . At their hotel later , Eddie leaves half of the remaining stake with a sleeping Charlie and leaves .
Eddie st ##ashes his belongings at the local bus terminal , where he meets Sarah Pack ##ard , an alcoholic who is supported by her father , attends college part @ - @ time , and walks with a lim ##p . He meets her again at a bar . They go back to her place but she refuses to let him in , saying he is " too hungry " . Eddie moves into a room ##ing house and starts hust ##ling for small stakes . He finds Sarah again and this time she takes him in , but with reservations . Charlie finds Eddie at Sarah ' s and tries to persuade him to go back out on the road . Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge F ##ats again . Eddie realizes that Charlie held out his percentage and becomes enraged , believing that with that money he could have rebounded to beat F ##ats . Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to " go lie down and die " by himself .
At Johnny ' s Bar , Eddie joins a poker game where Bert is playing , and loses $ 20 . Afterward , Bert tells Eddie that he has talent as a pool player but no character . He figures that Eddie will need at least $ 3 @ , @ 000 to challenge F ##ats again . Bert calls him a " born loser " but nevertheless offers to stake him in return for 75 % of his win ##nings ; Eddie refuses .
Eddie humili ##ates a local pool shark , exposing himself as a hust ##ler , and the other players punish him by breaking his thumb ##s . As he he ##als , Sarah cares for him and tells him she loves him , but he cannot say the words in return . When Eddie is ready to play , he agrees to Bert ' s terms , deciding that a " 25 % slice of something big is better than a 100 % slice of nothing " .
Bert , Eddie , and Sarah travel to the Kentucky Derby , where Bert arranges a match for Eddie against a wealthy local social ##ite named Find ##ley . The game turns out to be car ##om bill ##iards , not pool . When Eddie loses badly , Bert refuses to keep st ##aking him . Sarah ple ##ads with Eddie to leave with her , saying that the world he is living in and its inhabitants are " per ##verted , twisted , and crippled " ; he refuses . Seeing Eddie ' s anger , Bert agrees to let the match continue at $ 1 @ , @ 000 a game . Eddie comes back to win $ 12 @ , @ 000 . He collects his $ 3 @ , @ 000 share and decides to walk back to the hotel . Bert arrives first and subjects Sarah to a humiliating sexual encounter . After , she sc ##raw ##ls " P ##ER ##V ##ER ##T ##ED " , " T ##W ##IS ##T ##ED " , and " CR ##IP ##P ##L ##ED " in lip ##stick on the bathroom mirror . Eddie arrives back at the hotel to learn that she has killed herself .
Eddie returns to challenge F ##ats again , putting up his entire $ 3 @ , @ 000 stake on a single game . He wins game after game , beating F ##ats so badly that F ##ats is forced to quit . Bert demands a share of Eddie ' s win ##nings and threatens that Eddie will be injured unless he pays . But Eddie says that if he is not killed he will kill Bert when he recovers ; inv ##oking the memory of Sarah , he sh ##ames Bert into giving up his claim . Instead , Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big @ - @ time pool hall again . Eddie and F ##ats compliment each other as players , and Eddie walks out .

Pool champion Willie Mos ##coni has a cameo appearance as Willie , who holds the stakes for Eddie and F ##ats ' s games . Mos ##coni ' s hands also appear in many of the close ##up shots .

The T ##ev ##is novel had been option ##ed several times , including by Frank Sinatra , but attempts to adapt it for the screen were unsuccessful . Director Ross ##en ' s daughter Carol Ross ##en speculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction . Ross ##en , who had hust ##led pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool @ - @ themed play called Corner Pocket , option ##ed the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script .
According to Bobby Darin ' s agent , Martin Baum , Paul Newman ' s agent turned down the part of Fast Eddie . Newman was originally unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless , being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two for the S ##ees ##aw . Ross ##en offered Darin the part after seeing him on The Mike Wallace Interview . When Taylor was forced to drop out of S ##ees ##aw because of shooting overrun ##s on Cleopatra , Newman was freed up to take the role , which he accepted after reading just half of the script . No one associated with the production officially notified Darin or his representatives that he had been replaced ; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race .
Ross ##en filmed The Hust ##ler over six weeks , entirely in New York City . Much of the action was filmed at two now @ - @ defunct pool halls , McG ##ir ##r ' s and Ames Bill ##iard Academy . Other shooting locations included a town ##house on East 82nd Street , which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton ' s character Find ##ley , and the Manhattan Greyhound bus terminal . The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders . Willie Mos ##coni served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors . All of Gle ##ason ' s shots were his own ; they were filmed in wide @ - @ angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames . Ross ##en , in pursuit of the style he termed " neo @ - @ neo @ - @ realistic " , hired actual street th ##ugs , enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras . Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way to town ( originally slated to be the first scene of the film ) and a longer scene of Pre ##acher talking to Bert at Johnny ' s Bar which establishes Pre ##acher is a junk ##ie .
Early shooting put more focus on the pool playing , but during filming Ross ##en made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie ' s characters . Despite the change in emphasis , Ross ##en still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie ' s character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah , through the positioning of the characters in the frame . For example , when Eddie is playing Find ##ley , Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Find ##ley while still below Bert in a three shot . When Sarah enters the room , she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert . When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah ' s body , Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert , ending up on top of him . Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat F ##ats .

The Hust ##ler is fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being , cou ##ched within the context of winning and losing . Describing the film , Robert Ross ##en said : " My protagonist , Fast Eddie , wants to become a great pool player , but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being . He att ##ains self @ - @ awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game . " Roger Ebert conc ##urs with this assessment , citing The Hust ##ler as " one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering , by accepting reality instead of his dreams . "
The film was also somewhat autobiographical for Ross ##en , relating to his dealings with the House Un @ - @ American Activities Committee . A screenwriter during the 1930s and ' 4 ##0s , he had been involved with the Communist Party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his first HU ##AC appearance . Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members . Similarly , Fel ##son sells his soul and betr ##ays the one person who really knows and loves him in a Faust ##ian pact to gain character .
Film and theatre historian Ethan Mord ##den has identified The Hust ##ler as one of a handful of films from the early 1960s that re @ - @ defined the relationship of films to their audiences . This new relationship , he writes , is " one of challenge rather than fl ##atter ##y , of doubt rather than certainty . " No film of the 1950s , Mord ##den asserts , " took such a brutal , clear look at the ego @ - @ affirm ##ation of the one @ - @ on @ - @ one contest , at the inh ##uman ##ity of the winner or the cast ##rated vulnerability of the loser . " Although some have suggested the resemblance of this film to classic film noir , Mord ##den rejects the comparison based on Ross ##en ' s ultra @ - @ realistic style , also noting that the film lacks noir ' s " Tre ##acher ##ous Woman or its rel ##ish in discovering crime among the bourgeois ##ie , hungry bank clerks and l ##usty wives . " Mord ##den does note that while Fast Eddie " has a slight fifties ring " , the character " makes a decisive break with the extraordinarily feeling tough guys of the ' rebel ' era . . . [ b ] ut he does end up seeking out his emotions " and telling Bert that he is a loser because he ' s dead inside .

The Hust ##ler had its world premiere in Washington , D . C . on September 25 , 1961 . Prior to the premiere , Richard Burton hosted a midnight screening of the film for the casts of the season ' s Broadway shows , which generated a great deal of positive word of mouth . Initially reluctant to public ##ize the film , 20th Century Fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities .
The film was well received by critics , although with the occasional cave ##at . Variety praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the " s ##ord ##id aspects " of the story prevented the film from achieving the " goal of being pure entertainment . " Variety also felt the film was far too long . Stanley Kau ##ff ##mann , writing for The New Republic , concurred in part with this assessment . Kau ##ff ##mann strongly praised the principal cast , calling Newman " first @ - @ rate " and writing that Scott ' s was " his most credible performance to date . " Laurie , he writes , gives her part " moving ##ly ang ##u ##ished touches " ( although he also mildly criticizes her for over @ - @ reliance on Method acting ) . While he found that the script " strains hard to give an air of menace and criminal ##ity to the pool hall " and also declares it " full of pseudo @ - @ meaning " , Kau ##ff ##mann laud ##s Ross ##en ' s " sure , economical " direction , especially in regard to Gle ##ason who , he says , does not so much act as " [ pose ] for a number of pictures which are well arranged by Ross ##en . It is the best use of a man ##ik ##in by a director since Kaz ##an photographed Bur ##l Ives as Big Daddy . " The New York Times , despite finding that the film " str ##ays a bit " and that the romance between Newman and Laurie ' s characters " seems a m ##ite far @ - @ fet ##ched " , nonetheless found that The Hust ##ler " speaks powerful ##ly in a universal language that spell ##b ##ind ##s and reveals bitter truths . "
The Hust ##ler received nine Academy Award nominations . The film won two , for Best Art Direction @ - @ Set Dec ##oration , Black @ - @ and @ - @ White ( Harry Horner and Gene Call ##ahan ) and Best Cinematography , Black @ - @ and @ - @ White ( Eugen Sch ##ü ##ff ##tan ) .

In the decades since its release , The Hust ##ler has cemented its reputation as a classic . Roger Ebert , echoing earlier praise for the performances , direction , and cinematography and adding la ##ure ##ls for editor D ##ede Allen , cites the film as " one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories . " He further cites Fast Eddie Fel ##son as one of " only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as touch ##stones . " TV Guide calls the film a " dark stun ##ner " offering " a grim world whose only bright spot is the top of the pool table , yet [ with ] characters [ who ] maintain a sh ##ab ##by nobility and grace . " The four leads are again lavish ##ly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as " not to be missed . "
Paul Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie Fel ##son in the 1986 film The Color of Money , for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . A number of observers and critics have suggested that this Oscar was in bel ##ated recognition for his performance in The Hust ##ler . In 1997 , the Library of Congress selected The Hust ##ler for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as " culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant . " Carroll and Ross ##en ' s screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America in 2006 as the 96 ##th best motion picture screenplay of all time . In June 2008 , AFI released its " Ten top Ten " — the best ten films in ten " classic " American film genres — after polling over 1 @ , @ 500 people from the creative community . The Hust ##ler was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the sports genre .
The Hust ##ler is credited with sparking a resurgence in the popularity of pool in the United States , which had been on the decline for decades . The film also brought recognition to Willie Mos ##coni , who , despite having won multiple world championships , was virtually unknown to the general public . Perhaps the greatest benefic ##iary of the film ' s popularity was a real @ - @ life pool hust ##ler named Rudolf Wander ##one . Mos ##coni claimed in an interview at the time of the film ' s release that the character of Minnesota F ##ats was based on Wander ##one , who at the time was known as " New York F ##atty " . Wander ##one immediately adopted the Minnesota F ##ats nickname and parl ##ayed his association with the film into book and television deals and other ventures . Author Walter T ##ev ##is denied for the rest of his life that Wander ##one had played any role in the creation of the character . Other players would claim , with greater or lesser degrees of credibility , to have served as models for Fast Eddie , including Ronnie Allen , Ed Taylor , Ed Parker , and Eddie Pel ##key .
